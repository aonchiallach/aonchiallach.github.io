*Capital Markets, Financial Systems and the Postwar International Monetary System*

**The So-called Capital Markets**

_8_ The global capital markets through which trillions of dollars pass every day should be viewed as a charge on the productive system rather than a source of funds for new production.

_9_ Credit is lending money to people on the understanding that they will pay the money back later along with something extra, usually in the form of a rate of interest. 

This is not necessarily a capitalist innovation and large parts of national credit systems are not related to production at all. 

_10_ Because banks are empowered to create new money, far more money is circulating in the economy than has been derived from savings generated from value creation. Part of this money is therefore fictitious; it is derived not from the past but expectations it will be validated by future productive activity.

Banks play such an important role in the public economy because of their capacity to issue credit, which allows for the circulation of commodities, that the state constantly interferes in their operations. 

If investors could only invest real savings, the money they derive from value-creation, investing in fixed capital would be far more costly.
