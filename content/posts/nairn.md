_A note on terminology: Nairn uses the term 'Protestants' rather than 'unionists' and Ulster rather than 'the six counties' as 'Ulster'_

In the opening paragraphs of a chapter written on Ireland in _The Break-up of Britain_, Tom Nairn outlines his understanding of the conflict in the six counties. From his point of view it is a conflict between two communities, both of which are separate from Westminster and Leinster House, neither of whom are particularly invested in it going one way or the other. 

This is not an analysis that coincides with the facts. Successive British governments, both Labour and Conservative, directed their army, their intelligence services and loyal subjects to enthusiastically support those in the six counties who wished to remain within the Union. This support took the form of arms, training for loyalist paramilitaries, a uniquely brutal police force, targeted assassinations of prominent members in the nationalist community, conspiring against figures in Leinster House they regarded as sympathetic to the cause of unification, as well as bombing Dublin and Monaghan.

In Nairn's account of Ireland's modernisation there is a surfeit of pub talk about how it gave up the crown for the Holy Ghost and a defecit of material on how this might have something to do with the Saorstát remaining an imperial formation, bound by the terms of the so-called Anglo-Irish Treaty and a bourgeoisie with a material interest in maintaining social and economic continuity, or more latterly postwar American hegemony, the terms of which required open markets and the re-fashioning of the Saorstát as a beach head into European markets. Nairn describes unionists by contrast, as 'highly industrialised' because as a majority population in a statelet where there is a relatively large amount of industry, their demands for self-determination are _de facto_ progressive, modern, riding the tide of an advanced capitalist order, as opposed to the backwards claims of the underdeveloped Irish, which he encapsulates as 'the priest and the potato'.

Nairn has no patience for the idea that the six counties can be analysed from an imperial perspective, describing the notion that the Government of Ireland act was an attempt to stymie Irish independence as a simplistic, conspiratorial and 'pseudo-Marxist' account. Nairn is particularly irked here because it undermines the role of the authentically progressive actors here, 'the largest proletariat in (geographical) Ireland', representing them instead as lackeys of British imperialism. Nairn excoriates the likes of Eamon McCann, the Official IRA and People's Democracy whose programmes advocated (with varying degrees of ingenuousness) for a coming together of unionist and nationalist on the basis of a shared class interest, accusing them of being beholden to a cult of martyrdom surrounding James Connolly and the mistaken notion that a national revolution can be transformed into a social one, citing the clowncar of Conor Cruise O'Brien and the British and Irish Communist Organisation to this effect. Rather than the consequence of British imperial interest, the six counties are an entirely neutral outgrowth of this development gap. How Tyrone in 1922 could be described as developed in contrast to Donegal is beyond me, but he does also happen to be incorrect here. Loyalists such as Edward Carson expected the nine-county province of Ulster to be delivered into their hands, but the calculus was that the garrison state would be unsustainable were it to include the significant nationalist populations of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan. That this was a pragmatic decision is further evinced by unionist leaders speculating during the long war, that the restive South Armagh could be traded with the Saorstát for more scenic parts of Donegal. For Nairn the only form of imperialism that exists today are capital investments from metropolian or core countries, which have, we are told, an interest in abolishing borders and eliminating racial dominance as well as ethnic feuds. Nairn of course never tells us what countries these multi-nationals are based in because this would require him to admit that they are not nationless entities falling out of the sky, but rather arise out of the same countries with a history of grinding other nations beneath the yoke. 

However Nairn seems confused on this point. He wants to celebrate the 1974 Ulster Worker's Council Strike, 'without doubt the most successful political action carried out by any European working class since the World War', but this of course requires him to pass over the fact that this strike aimed to overturn a constitutional settlement that might have granted the nationalist population some modicum of democratic representation in the running of the statelet in which they found themselves. Nairn is not completely above becoming frustrated at the many ways in which his world-historical progressive force is showing itself to be in many ways regressive, as seen in their anti-Catholicism rooted in seventeenth-century history, which is only a bizarre aberration, nothing to do with the plantations. So while he might on the one hand dismiss the idea that the unionist population are settlers in the same way Rhodesians or the _pieds noirs_ are, he admits at the same time that they have many socio-cultural features in common; cross-class alliances, bigotry and so forth. What he offers by way of alternative explanation is a useless series of riffs about how unionists feel and behave, without bringing into the picture their particular class composition, their specific relationship with multinational capital, what kinds of industry are present in the six counties, how Catholics relate to them, whether or not being chased out of shipyards might have something to do with Catholics being under-represented in the largest proletariat on the island. When it comes to Ireland, Nairn was strictly vibes only, preferring to throw around references to bowler hats and Finn MacCool as if this was acceptable.

Not only is granting unionists their own nation the only way to break them from their religiously-inspired racism, but socialists who do not agree with Nairn are moralising philistines, existing in a long-tradition of philistinism going all the way back to Marx and Engels who granted the right of self-determination in some contexts, but withdrew it in others. As Marx and Engels knew, the national question could be viewed separately from confronting imperialism. Self-determination is about wounding the vampire squid in as many place as you can, to strengthen leverage against it at all points. If socialist organisations seek to afford self-determination in some contexts while grainting it in others we could look at the reasons why. Extra-territorial claims perhaps. A history of expropriation and / or genocide, paramilitary violence. Crimes against humanity. Or perhaps the Marxists are wrong and once Lenin got into power he shuold have allowed Germany to annex as much territory as they wanted.

That Nairn can write a sentence about the activity of the British government in Ireland in 1972 claiming that this was the year that marked the end of a 'long British tradition of relucant, last-minute intervention in Irish affairs', about sums it up. Nairn set out to write a book about Britain. In his section on England's first colony, the key to understanding everything that has happened since, he has revealed himself to not only lack the most basic command over the materials, but has split his model apart in trying to fit the evidence. He then spends forty pages moping over the pieces. Anyone who presents this book as a guide for the Union over the next number of decades is proudly announcing their intention to charge down a blind alley.
