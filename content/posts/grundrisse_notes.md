*Introduction*

**1. Production, Consumption, Distribution, Exchange (Circulation)**

***(1) Production***

_Independent Individuals, Eighteenth-century Ideas_

_83_ Begins with a dismissal of the accounts of political economy provided by bourgeois economists who imagine political economy as functioning in the same way as it is represented in Daniel Defoe's novel _Robinson Crusoe_, an aesthetic semblance of individual autonomy.

_84_ Looking back into pre-history the fact of the individual belonging to a far larger social totality becomes more and more obvious; it is only in the eighteenth century, with production and social relations at their most developed point, the creation of 'civil society' that an individual confronts sociality as a means to their own end.

_Eternalisation of historic relations of production. -Production and distribution in general. -Property_

_85_ As production refers to a particular stage of development, considering production requires us to investigate its historical forms or declare at the outset which epoch we are referring to production within.

Each epoch does have characteristics in common, but production in general is an abstraction. refers to production at a definite stage of social development, undertaken by social individuals. 

_86_ Production is therefore not confined to a specific sector of production, it is a broader social occurrence, it forms a totality.

This broader social metabolism within which production occurs is ignored by political economists such as John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith.

_87_ This means their works digress into tautology; claiming that certain races locations, climates or natural conditions are more advantageous to production than others amounts to nothing more than wealth is more easily created where it exists to a greater extent.

The aim here is to present production according to eternal natural laws independently of history, which allows the smuggling of bourgeois political economy and bourgeois ideology into the picture, under the guise of scientific analysis.

Definition of production: production is the appropriation of nature on the part of an individual within and though a specific form of society.

In this sense it is a tautology to say that property is a precondition of production. The conceptual leap here is that private property or bourgeois law is a pre-condition.

_88_ Historically it is common property that is the more common form, in ancient or tribal societies.

***(2) The General Relation of Production to Distribution, Exchange, Consumption***

In production members of society shape the products of nature in accordance with human needs.

_89_ Distribution determines the proportion in which the individual shares in the product.

Exchange delivers the particular products into which the individual desires to convert the portion which distribution has assigned to him.

In consumption the products become objects of individual gratification.

Production creates the objects, distribution divides them according to social laws, exchange parcels out the divided shares according to individual needs, in consumption the object moves outside this social movement and becomes a direct object and servant of individual need.

Production is the point of departure, distribution and exchange the middle and consumption the conclusion. 

Distribution and exchange are themselves twofold since distribution is determined by society and exchange is conducted by individuals. 

The person objectifies himself in production, the thing subjectifies itself in the person, in distribution society mediates between production and consumption in the form of general, dominant determinants and in exchange the two are mediated by the chance characteristics of the individual.

Production is the generality, distribution and exchange the particularity and consumption the singularity in which the whole is integrated.

_[Consumption and Production]_

_90_ Production is also consumption. The individual not only develops his abilities in production but also expends them, uses them up in the act of production, just as natural procreation is the consumption of life forces.

The means of production and raw materials are consumed in their use and dissolved into their elements again; this is productive consumption.

_91_ They are the same, but at the same time a mediating movement takes place between the two. Without production consumption would lack an object. 

_Distribution and Production_

_95_ Bourgeois economists disassociate production from distribution; ground rent, wages, interest and profit are features of distribution while land, labour and capital appear as agents of production.

In the case of capital this leads to a situation in which they are posited doubly; as agent of production, as source of income and determinant of specific forms of distribution

Interest and profit are also figured as agents of production in the sense that they are forms in which capital increases. Interest and profit as forms of distribution presuppose capital as an agent of production. 
Similarly, distribution appears merely as the obverse of the agents of production whereas distribution is itself a product of production.

_97 - 8_ Deals with various historic phases through which production has proceeded, the point of which is that production is not new, nor it is wedded to industrial production, the mode of pillage for example is determined by the regnant forms of production. 

***Exchange, finally, and Circulation***

_Exchange and Production_

Circulation is a specific moment of exchange, and it is also exchange in its totality.

_99_ Exchange appears independent of and indifferent to production only in the final phase where product is exchanged for consumption.

But there is no exchange without division of labour, private exchange presupposes private production, the intensity of exchange, its velocity, are determined by the development and structure of production.

These are not identical, but they all form members of a totality, distinctions within a unity. 

Production predominates, not only over itself, in the antithetical definition of production, but over other moments as well; the process always returns to production to begin anew.

***(3) The Method of Political Economy***

_100_ Economists in the seventeenth century always initiated their studies by living wholes; population, nation states, groups of states, and conclude by their analysis with a series of abstractions, general relations such as divisions of labour, money, value, etc.

As soon as these individual moments had been firmly established and abstracted economic systems developed, which ascended from the simple relations.

_101_ These were labour, division of labour, exchange value, to the level of the state and exchange betweeen nations.

This is the correct method.

The concrete is the concrete because it is the coming together of many determinations, it is unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, as a proces of concentration, as a resultnot as a point of departure. 

The incorrect method would be to begin with the abstractions. This was Hegel's mistake, conceiving the real as a product of thought conceiving itself.
