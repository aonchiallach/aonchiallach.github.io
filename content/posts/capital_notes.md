**Chapter One: Commodities**

**The Two Factors of the Commodity**

*125* The capitalist economy consists of commodities. A commodity is an object of consumption or of production. It satisfies a need and this need is referred to as the commodity’s use-value.

_[126 Footnote cites Locke ‘The natural worth of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities, or serve the conveniences of human life’._

_Funny sidebar: ‘In English writers of the seventeenth century we still often find the word ‘worth’ used for use-value and ‘value’ for exchange value. This is quite in accordance with the spirit of a language that likes to use a Teutonic word for the actual thing, and a Romance word for its reflection’.]_

Where these needs arise from is a broader social question but use-value is also in the physical thing itself; it has a real existence and the use is realised in the commodity’s consumption whereas the thing-ness of the commodity is the bearer of its exchange-value.

_[Footnote: ‘In bourgeois society the legal fiction prevails that each person, as a buyer, has an encyclopaedic knowledge of commodities’.]_

*127* Exchange-value renders a commodity commensurate, makes it possible to compare and conflate it with other things and have it move around in exchange for those things. So a given commodity, e.g. wheat ‘has many exchange values instead of one’. So we might say 1 corn = x iron and x wool and x coal etc.

This exchange value is an abstraction, it expresses use value at a level beyond the mere commodity itself, it is quantitative.

*128* Use value is qualitative, it works at the point of consumption. If you’re hungry, cheese will do you while steel won’t. 

Exchange value works at the point of quantity; if you’re hungry and you have steel you could exchange it for cheese, but these two functions are distinct. You can’t eat an exchange value or hammer it into a car.

In order to penetrate into exchange value it is necessary to abstract from the commodity’s physicality. Considered from the perspective of exchange value, the commodity’s physical, tangible, sensuous aspects are evacuated. Viewed the perspective of exchange it’s not important that something is a table or a piece of yarn, more that it is an abstract incarnation of human labour.

*129* And as this value is quantitative, the decisive unit is the amount of labour which ‘is measured by its duration…on the particular scale of hours, days, etc’.

This doesn’t mean that if a labourer takes six months to make a single shirt that shirt is worth millions, because while it is a quantitative measurement its also an abstract one; all human labour is considered here as a single homogenous mass. Labour-power, the magnitude of labour-power, is ‘a socially average unit of labour power and acts as such, i.e. only needs, in order to produce a commodity, the labour time which is necessary on average’. 

So there is an equilibrium which is called socially necessary labour-time. And this average is ‘the labour time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society’. 

The example Marx gives is English hand-loom weavers after the introduction of power-looms, which ‘reduced…by one half the labour required to convert a given quantity of yarn into woven fabric. In order to do this the English hand-loom weaver in fact needed the same amount of labour-time as before; but the product of his individual hour of labour now only represented half an hour of social labour, and consequently fell to one half its former value’. 

_[Footnote in which Marx finds his theory anticipated in a document on Money written in the 1730’s]_

*130* So the value of a commodity would remain static if the labour-time required for production remained static. But this changes with every variation in the productivity of labour, which is very much effected by advances in technology and machinery as well as:

1. the worker’s average degree of skill
2. the social organisation of the producers of production
3. the extent and effectiveness of the means of production
4. conditions found in the natural environment (e.g. the same quantity of labour is present in eight bushels of corn in favourable seasons and only four in unfavourable seasons, ‘the same quantity of labour provides more metal in rich mines than in poor’.)

_131_ So there are enormous differences of context that dictate fluctuations in value: 

_‘In general, the greater their productivity of labour, the less the labour-time required to produce an article, the less the mass of labour crystallised in that article, and the less its value. The value of a  commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productivity, of the labour which finds its realisation within the commodity’._

A thing can be a use-value without being a value, i.e. directly obtained without mediation through exchange and the example is the peasant who farms for direct consumption of himself or his feudal lord: 

_‘Neither the corn-rent nor the corn-tithe became commodities simply by being produced for others. In order to become a commodity the product must be transferred to the other person, for whom it serves as a use-value, through the medium of exchange’._

**2. The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities**

_132_ In a society based on commodity production, labour is necessarily divided.

_133_ _‘in a society of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour which are carried on independently and privately by individual producers develops into a complex system, a social division of labour’._

But labour was also a condition of human existence before commodities as defined above became dominant; clothes were made in antiquity, farming was divided in pre-historical agriculture.

_137_ The between concrete versus abstract labour is introduced here; the former pertains to use value, the second to exchange.

**3. The Value Form, or Exchange-Value**

_138_ Commodities have both concrete and abstract traits, the natural hunger-satisfying aspects of cheese, the durability of steel, but also the fact of them containing crystallised labour power. 

_141_ Once again it is this value form that allows commodities to become commensurate with one another.

_142_ Labour-power is not value in itself, it only becomes value once it is concretised in an objective form.

_143 ‘As a use-value, the linen is something palpably different from the coat; as value, it is identical with the coat, and therefore looks like the coat. Thus the linen acquires a value-form different from its natural form. Its existence as value is manifested in its equality with the coat, just as the sheep-like nature of the Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God’._

_145_ As before this commensurability varies in context, _‘the labour-time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every influence in the productivity of the weaver or the tailor’_

_147_ *Commodity A* (the linen) imposes on *Commodity B* a form of value particular to it, the equivalent. The linen brings into view its own existence as a value in the fact that it can be assumed as a form of value separate from its own physical being. In this way the commodity’s value is no longer qualitative but becomes relative,

_148_ because a commodity can never express the magnitude of its own value. It needs that reflection in the form of a *Commodity B*.

_149_ Value is therefore social, it’s not something that can be measured independently, we can’t use this method to understand the amount of value in a single tyre or cheese-wheel taken outside of its context in the productive process.

_150_ Another thing that commensurability makes possible, is the comparison of concrete or private labour in the linen with the abstract or social labour embodied in the coat.

_151_ Section about how Aristotle could not think his way past market relations without this concept of value, so he couldn’t see that what every pair of commodities have in common is abstract labour.

_153_ Examples of two schools of orthodox economists who only grapple with one side of value, whether quantitative or qualitative, and miss the actual phenomenon as a result.

_156_ There is no end to this process of comparison and exchange: _‘it follows that the relative form of value of each commodity is an endless series of expressions of value which are all different from the relative form of value of every other commodity’._

_162_ The general form of value then gives way to the money form. 

**4. The Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secret**

_167_ This next step from value to money is a necessary extension because producers do not come into contact with one another on the market through barter, their purchases are mediated through the market. 

_168_ It takes a long time and a certain amount of development before this market becomes a generalised law, before the production of commodities has become fully developed, but underneath this law, whose relations are obscured or reified because the way the market operates is not necessarily traceable _‘is therefore a secret hidden under the apparent movements in the relative values of commodities’._

_169_ The reified character of these social relations find their expression in the self-evidently incorrect assertions put forward by orthodox political economists. 

_[175 footnote: ‘the vulgar economists confine themselves to systematising in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlasting truths, the banal and complacent notions held by the bourgeois agents of production about their own world, which is to them the best possible one’, and he calls a few of these economists dwarfs and asses.]_

_170_ Uses feudalism and the story of Robinson Crusoe (a novel written by Daniel Defoe and published in 1719 about a man who washes up on an island off the coast of Venezuela and establishes a ‘self-sufficient society’) in order to describe moments, whether historical or imagined, in which the trajectory of commodities, outputs of labour and / or agriculture are clear: _‘the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour appear at all events as their own personal relations, and are not disguised as social relations between things, between the products of labour’._

_171_ Rare, brief reference to what a communist society would look like:

_‘Let us finally imagine…an association of free men, working with the means of production held in common, and expending their many different forms of labour-power in full self-awareness as one single social labour force’._

_172 - 176_ Just some fantastic riffs on political economy and Christianity.

**Chapter 2: The Process of Exchange**

_178_ Commodities cannot circulate by themselves,

_179_ their buyers and sellers must encounter one another in the market as 'personifications of economic relations'

For the seller, a commodity has no use-value, for the buyer it does. This changing of hands constitutes exchange.

_181_ Money arises out of these requirements and further entrenches the separation between use-value and value. 

_182 - 3_ Brief account of the historical roots of money, how it first arises among nomadic peoples because 'all their worldly possessions are in a movable and therefore directly alienable form, and because their mode of life, by continually bringing them into contact with foreign communities, encourages the exchange of products'.

_183_ In order to better service the needs of circulation in a modern society, the money-form assumes the shape of precious metals as these are naturally the commodities best fitted to 'perform the social function of a universal equivalent'

_184_ firstly because their 'every sample possesses the same uniform quantity' and secondly because they are divisible.

_185_ Just because precious metals represent a symbol of value does not mean that they are unreal; they give witness to an actual social relationship, namely a series of exchanges which necessitate a common unit. As with commodities, precious metals exist on both the concrete and abstract levels: 'every commodity is a symbol, since, as value, it is only the material shell of the human labour expended on it'.

_186_ Money is also similar to the commodity in the sense that its value can only be expressed in other forms of itself, this value being determined 'by the labour-time required for its production...expressed in the quantity of any other commodity in which the same amount of labour-time is congealed'.

_187_ Once money has become a universal equivalent, human activity becomes increasingly atomised: 'Their own relations of production...assume a material shape which is independent of their control and their conscious individual action'.

**Chapter 3: Money, or the Circulation of Commodities**

**1. The Measure of Values**

_188_ It is not just money that renders commodities commensurate, they already are commensurate by virtue of having human labour in common.

_189_ But money does grant this equation of commodities a socially valid character, there is no longer any need for the 1 iron = 5 wheat because of money.

_191_ Gold then becomes a universal measurement: 'in spite of the confusing variety of the commodities themselves, their values become magnitudes of the same denomination, gold-magnitudes'. 

_193_ Digression on how the price of money and the price of commodities are independent; one may rise and one may fall, both may rise or fall together.

The terms originally assigned to specific amounts of precious metals (a 'pound' initially referred to a pound of silver) become autonomous over time because of:

1. the introduction of foreign coinage which develop different names
2. the development of material wealth; copper edging out silver, edged out in turn by gold
3. successive waves of de-valuation

_194_ In this way the nature of money has been reified beyond its actual function, a confusion that is assisted by the fact that they at once real and unreal. 

_[One enduring controversy of Marxist economics and / or Marxology is known as the transformation problem, namely whether or not Marx provides us with a comprehensive account of how the abstract value of the commodity becomes a concrete price in a competitive marketplace. There are a number of comments in this chapter which pertain to this question so they will be signalled from this point on]_

_196_ _Material on the Transformation Problem_

The magnitude of a commodity's value expresses the socially average labour-time required to produce it. When this commodity's value is realised, when it is sold, this appears as the exchange-ratio between a single commodity and the money-commodity.

This relation may express the magnitude of value and the greater or lesser quantity of money it can be sold for according to a particular set of circumstances. Therefore there is the possibility that there will be a disproportion between these two; in fact this asymmetry is fundamental to the price-form. 

_'This is not a defect, but, on the contrary, it makes this form the adequate one for a mode of production whose laws can only assert themselves as blindly operating averages between constant irregularities'._

_197_ Price might cease to express value altogether; one could sell courage or honour, things which command a price without value, but it might also conceal a real value-relation.

**2. The Means of Circulation**

**(a) The Metamorphosis of Commodities**

_198_ Great image regarding the nature of contradiction 

_'it is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another and at the same time constantly flying away from it. The ellipse is a form of motion within which this contradiction is both realised and resolved'._

This paradoxical occurrence within the mode of production known as capitalism is called the social metabolism.

_200_ We are given a simple, two-stage equation to express the process of exchange:

Commodity -> Money -> Commodity or CMC

The first stage, commodity to money, is the decisive moment, this decides whether or not a commodity can command a price. 

_201 - 3_ In order for a commodity to command a price, it must have a use-value for the purchaser.

_Material on the Transformation Problem_

_'We leave out of consideration here any possible subjective errors in calculation by the owner of the commodity, which will immediately be corrected objectively in the market. We suppose him to have spent only the average socially necessary quantity of labour time. The price of the commodity...is merely the money-name of the quantity of social labour objectified in it'._

The articulation of this metamorphosis is however, not straightforward, it place in haphazard and spontaneous ways across the market, the sellers:

_'find out that the same division of labour which turns them into private producers also makes the social process of production and the relations of the individual producers to each other...independent of the producers themselves'._

_'The realisation of a commodity's price, or of its merely ideal value-form, is therefore at the same time, and inversely, the realisation of the merely ideal use-value of money; the conversion of a commodity into money is the conversion of money into a commodity'._

Every purchase is a sale, every sale a purchase, C -> M is also at once M -> C from the point of view of the buyer. 

_208_ But this does not mean equilibrium is achieved. Every sale might well be a purchase, but they constitute two separate acts between two people in opposition to one another.

_209_ The independence of buyers and sellers may also assert themselves; this is what happens in a crisis within a capitalist economy. 

**(b) The Circulation of Money**

_213_ As money and commodities always come into physical confrontation with each other, the amount of money that is required to facilitate their movement in exchange is equal to the sum of all prices. Since prices rise and fall, the amount of money required to move commodities around may also rise or fall. 

_214_ More on price:

_'one commodity infects another through their common value-relation, so that their prices, expressed in gold or silver, gradually settle down into the proportions determined by their comparative values, until finally the values of all commodities are estimated in terms of the new value of the monetary metal'._

_216_ A decisive factor in this regard is the question of turnover:

the quantity of money functioning as the circulating medium = the sum of prices / divided the number of times coins of the same denomination turn over

The measure of how often a coin turns over is known as its velocity.

Velocity differs significantly according to context, place, time, level of social development etc. 

If there are less turnovers, less coin is necessary and vice versa.

_217_ These dynamics also might provoke the system into crisis as they are non-simultaneous. As before, orthodox economists ascribe this to insufficient money in the system.

_[218 Footnote: this is not to suggest that insufficient money in the system is not one of the causes of some crises, but it is only one reason among others and often serves the purpose of excluding more long-run dynamics from consideration.]_

**(c) Coin. The Symbol of Value**

_221_ In sum, average value commands average price.

_222 - 3_ History of the use of precious metals as money, the role of the state in minting them.

_224_ Introduction of credit and paper money into the argument. 

_225_ Only insofar as paper money represents gold does it have value.

**3. Money**

**(a) Hoarding**

_227_ As money becomes that universal repository of value, the urge develops to retain a hold over it, as it is an index of social power. 

_229 - 230_ Various quotes from classical sources about the dangers of money as tending towards the destruction of previously existing social relations.

**(b) Means of Payment**

_235_ As purchase and sale are non-identical, certain forms of monetary infrastructure develop between buyers, sellers, debtors and borrowers to offset their debts. This reduces the amount of actual money moving around as money is functioning only nominally on balance sheets. 

_236_ This is what brings markets flooded with credit into crisis every few years; a sudden realisation that there's no money behind this movement of assets.

**Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital**

_247_ The circulation of commodities as the starting-point of capital.

[Origin of capitalism]

_'The production of commodities and their circulation in its developed form, namely trade, form the historic presuppositions under which capital arises. World trade and the world market date from the sixteenth century, and from then on the modern history of capital starts to unfold'._

Money is the first form of capital.

The first distinction between money and capital is the simple distinction between the difference in their form of circulation in C-M-C and re-conversion of money into commodities - selling in order to buy.

_248_ The movement of M-C-M passes through two antithetical phases.

The first phase = M-C (the purchase): Money is changed into a commodity.

The second phase = C-M (the sale): Commodity is changed back again into money.

_'These two phases, conceived of in a unity, constitute the total movement which exchanges money for a commodity, and the same commodity for money, which buys a commodity in order to sell it.'_

At root here is the exchange of money for money, M-M.

_249_ In C-M-C, money is at the end converted into a commodity that serves as a use-value, it has been spent once and for all.

In this phase, the same piece of money is displaced twice; the seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to another seller.

In M-C-M, the buyer lays out money so that he can get money back. The money is not spent, it is only advanced.

Here, it is not the money that moves twice but the commodity; the twofold displacement of the same piece of money causes the money to flow back to its original point of departure. 

_252_ It is also possible that in C-M-C, the two extremes may represent quantitatively different magnitudes of value. The peasant may sell his corn at higher than its original value or more, he may be cheated by the clothes merchant, but these differences are accidents, they don't change the substance of what is happening.

When selling in order to buy, we aim at satisfying one's needs via consumption.

When buying in order to sell our end and our beginning are the same: €100 -> €110, capital M -> M', this increase in capital becomes an end in itself.

_253_ Footnote about how Aristotle's grasp of political economy represents the stage of economic development at which his society was at the time. Aristotle describes how trade was barter but as trade developed further money became necessary as the lubricant to facilitate transactions on a broader scale.

This creates a field separable from economics; chrematistics, which revolves around money as a beginning and end, and these, for Aristotle, are often confused.

_254_ The conscious bearer of this ovement is a capitalist. He is the person from whom money departs and to whom it returns.

_'it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever more wealth in the abstract is the sole driving force behind his operations that he functions as a capitalist...Use-values must therefore never be treated as the immediate aim of the capitalist; nor must the profit on any single transaction. His aim is rather the unceasing movement of profit-making'._

_255_ Money is both independent, becoming itself in abolishing itself, but is also the active subject.

_256_ This is a situation that does not just apply to merchant capital or trade but also to industrial capital, which operates according to the same logic. 

_257_ M-C-M' is the general form of capital.

**Chapter 5: Contradictions in the General Formula**

_258_ The two people involved on either pole of M-C-M' have no relationship with one another, they are confronted only in the context of individual transactions, not the overall cycle.

[On the issue of circulation and value-formation: Important to note that he prefaces this with making clear that this is an abstract example]

_260_ What is happening here is a change in form, the value remains constant as the same quantity of social labour remains in the hand of the commodity-owner, in the form of the commodity or in the form of money; it is not an increase in value.

_261 - 2_ Some of the mistakes bourgeois economists make in taking circulation for value creation.

_262_ _'It is plain that no one abstracts more value from circulation than he throws into it'._

_263_ The formation of surplus value has nothing to do with whether a commodity was sold above its value or not.

[The transformation problem]

_269 'If prices actually differ from values, we must first reduce the former to the latter, i.e. disregard this situation as an accidental one in order to observe the phenomenon of the formation of capital on the basis of the exchange of commodities in its purity, and to prevent our observations from being interfered with by disturbing incidental circumstances which are irrelevant to the actual course of the process...The continual oscillations in prices, their rise and fall, compensate each other, cancel each other out, and carry out their own reduction to an average price which is their internal regulator'._

**Chapter 6: The Sale and Purchase of Labour Power**

_270_ Labour as a source of value.

_271_ In order for the commodity owner to increase the value of the commodities in their possession they must find, on the market, a person willing to sell their own labour capacity. They enter into relations with each other as equals in the eyes of the law.

The seller of labour power sells their labour for a limited period, rather than all in one go, as this would make them a slave, 'from an owner of a commodity into a commodity'.

_272 - 3_ The owner of labour power must also have no other commodity for sale...'he is rid of them, he is free of all the objects needed for the realisation of his labour-power'.

[Historical transition to capitalism]

_274_ On the conditions which make capitalism possible: money, as we have seen, exists prior to the existence of capitalism propert, but commodity circulation is, at this time, limited in terms of how far it can develop'. 

_'The historical conditions of its existence [capital] are by no means given with the mere circulation of money and commodities. It arises only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence finds the free worker available, on the market, as the seller of his own labour power. And this one historical pre-condition comprises a world's history'._

The labour-time necessary for the production of a commodity determines the value of labour-power, it represents no more than a definite quantity of the average social labour embodied within it.

[Althusser's reading of capital]

_275_ On the moral and historical nature of wages

_276 - 7_ The rate of wages, in additional to these historical and moral elements, is also determined by how much it costs for the worker to reproduce their own conditions of existence.

_279_ Statement on the method of Capital:

_'The consumption of labour-power is completed, as in the case of every other community, outside the market or the sphere of circulation. Let us therefore, in company with the owner of money and the owner of labour-power, leave this noisy sphere, where everything takes place on the surface and in full view of everyone, and follow them into the hidden abode of production'_

**Chapter 7: The Labour Process and the Valorisation Process**

*1. The Labour Process*

_283_ We begin by considering labour as something outside any specific social or historical formation at first, as:

_'a process between man and nature, a process by which man, through his own actions, mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and nature'._

_284_ This activity is specific to man. This is not to say that animals don't work, but man is unique in that man envisions what he does or make ideally before he does so.

Difference between raw materials and the 'free gifts of nature'

_'All those things which labour merely separates from immediate connection with their environment are objects of labour spontaneously provided by nature, such as fish caught and separated from their natural element, namely water, timber felled in virgin forests, and ores extracted from their veins. If, on the other hand, the object of labour has, so to speak, been filtered through previous labours, we call it raw material'._

_285_ As such, agriculture requires a relatively significant amount of social development

_286_ _'Franklin therefore defines man as 'a tool-making animal'. Relics of bygone instruments of labour possess the same importance for the investigation of extinct economic formations of society as do fossil bones for the determination of extinct species of animals. It is not what is made but how, and by what instruments of labour, that distinguishes different economic epochs. Instruments of labour not only supply a standard of the degree of development which human labour has attained, but they also indicate the social relations within which men work'._

_287_ Considered as a creation of use-value, what happens in the labour process is that a use-value is created by adapting natural material to human need. This is done by labour being induced into the object. What appeared from the worker's point of view as exertion or 'unrest' is now a fixed, objective characteristic in an object. 

Use-values forged in previous exertions of labour power also enter into the labour process in the creation ofa new object, products are the output of labour but they are also inputs. 

_288_ They may form a crucial part of the resultant commodity, such as lead going into solder or they may be only accessories such as oil being used to light the factory. 

_289_ In encountering these objects the living labour power of the worker awakens the dead labour in these objects from the dead into real and effective use-value.

_290_ The use living labour puts them to is a form of consumption known as 'productive consumption'. This is distinct from individual consumption in that it is not a using up of products for subsistence purposes while productive consumption aims at the production of use values, 'the everlasting nature-imposed condition of human existence'.

_291_ As the capitalist purchases labour power through the workers' wages he owns the labour-power as a commodity, and deploys it as he sees fit; i.e. its application to the dead labour of other products he owns, to imbue their dead labour with living labour to preserve their use-values for sale. 

*2. The Valorisation Process*

_294_ The preservation or use-values can require labour-power to be imbued in a product at a number of different places and times, picking the cotton and spinning the yarn can all be considered as different stages in the same labour process.

_296_ In the course of a given labour process, a specific quantity of labour has entered the resultant commodity, but only socially necessary labour time counts towards this value's creation.

_298_ Presents an example whereby the capitalist might recoup no profit.

_300_ The use-value of labour and the wages extended in order to recoup that use-value are non-identical.

_301_ Account of how surplus value is transformed into capital.

_302_ If the process of recouping surplus value proceeds, it is part of the process of valorisation.

[Slavery]

_303_ Footnote regarding why slavery was inefficient in comparison w/ capitalism.

_305_ The concrete labour performed will become abstract.

_[Footnote on skilled versus unskilled labour; suggests skilled labour is a kink that will be steadily transformed into unskilled labour over time.]_

**Chapter 8: Constant Capital and Variable Capital**

_307_ Summary of the previous chapter.

It is not the case that the worker labours to create new value on the one hand and produces value on the other; labour is twofold and both of these processes occur simultaneously. 

_309_ Presents an example whereby a machine is developed that allows a spinner to become six times more effective and to spin as much cotton in 6 hours as he formerly accomplished in 36. This 36lbs of cotton absorbs the same amount of labour as the 6lbs did formerly, but the value added by the labour of the spinner to each pound of raw material is a sixth of what it was before. 

It is possible for the exchange value of the cotton to fluctuate if this technological innovation is introduced unevenly across the market; if a capitalist has a stockpile of cotton, they will find that the exchange value of his cotton has decreased by ~85%.  

_310_ While new value and old value are added or revived are different processes, they are added in proportion to one another.

_311_ Means of production transfer new value to the commodity but only insofar as they lose their use and exchange value:

_312_ they cannot transfer more value than they lose during the process by the destruction of their own use-value.

If a machine is worth €10,000 and wears out in 10,000 days it transfers one-thousandth of its value every day. The machine continues to take part in the labour process throughout this period but in a way that it is increasingly diminished. 

_'Thus it appears that one factor of the labour process, a means of production, continually enters as a whole into that process, while it only enters in parts into the valorisation process'. _

_317_ Surplus value produces value over and above the value contained in the materials productively consumed in the course of the labour process.

Capital deployed in the labour process splits into two parts; constant and variable capital. 

Constant capital, or _C_, refers to capital turned into means of production; raw material, auxiliary material and instruments of labour which do not undergo any quantitative alteration in the productive process.

Variable capital, or _v_, is capital which does undergo a quantitative alteration of value. It reproduces the equivalent of its own value, is transformed into labour and produces an excess or surplus which varies in turn according to circumstances. 

**Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus Value**

*1. The Degree of Exploitation of Labour Power*

_322_ Proof that an increase in value is due to _v_, which sets _C_ = 0.

_323_ The precise concrete form that constant capital assumes is irrelevant, all that matters is that it absorbs labour expended in production.

_324_ If we subtract new value produced from the total expended on the labour process we are left with the amount of surplus value and from these two figures we can calculate the rate of profit or 'the relative magnitude of the surplus value'.

_327_ This rate of exploitation expresses how much of the working day is composed of socially necessary labour time.

**Chapter 10: The Working Day**

*The Limits of the Working Day*

_341_ The precise length of the working day varies; it does not always align with the exact number of hours a worker requires in order to reproduce their own conditions of existence; its total length varies with the duration of surplus labour expended.

It does however have hard limits, whether physical, mental or social, and these all vary according place, time, social, cultural development etc.

_342_ The working day is therefore an important site of struggle as the capitalist has extended variable capital in the form of wages in order to assert their control over the workers' labour-power with a view to extracting a surplus over and above what he has paid for. (This is why the then-contemporary reformist notion of extracting a 'just price' for one's work is a nonsense)

*2. The Voracious Appetite for Surplus Labour. Manufacturer and Boyar*

[Transition to Capitalism]

_344_ Surplus value pre-dates capitalism and can be found at any point in history in which a particular section of society enjoys a monopoly over the means of production, whether plantations in the southern United States or Norman baronies. In this situation workers will always be compelled to expend some of their own labour in order to extract their own sustenance.

_345_ However production for the sake of use-value as under feudalism introduces hard limits to surplus value extraction, there will be no accumulation of surplus value as an end in itself, at least until money becomes generalised as a universal equivalent.

[Slavery]

_'as soon as peoples whose production still moves within the lower forms of slave-labour...are drawn into a world market dominated by the capitalist mode of production, whereby the sale of their products for export develops into their principal interest, the civilised horrors of over-work are grafted onto the barbaric horrors of slavery, serfdom etc. Hence he Negro labour in the southern states of the American Union preserved a moderately patriarchal character as long as production as directed to the satisfaction of immediately local requirements. But in proportion as the export of cotton became of vital interest to consumption of his life in seven years of labour, became a  factor in a calculated and calculating system. It was no longer a question of obtaining from him a certain quantity of useful products, but rather of the production of the surplus-value itself'._

_346_ As the labourer works simultaneously for the capitalist (creating surplus value) and for his wages (reproducing his own conditions of existence) exploitation is not directly visible as it was under feudalism, when toil would be conducted on the lord's field separate from his own holdings.

_348_ The English Factory Acts had the effect of imposing restrictions on the capitalist's ability to recoup surplus from the labourer; this was won in the course of struggle and also because it is sometimes necessary for the bourgeois state to step in and mediate between capital and labour.

_358_ Brief sidenote on how capitalism subsumes industries under feudalism: 'Capitalism is...at first indifferent towards the technical character of the labour process it seizes control of. At the outset, it takes it as it finds it'.

Concrete study of how the production process and the profit motive changes the output of bread produced in bakeries.

_366_ Amazing quote from Dr. Richardson:

_'The occupation, instinctive almost as a portion of human art, unobjectivionable as a branch of human industry, is made by mere excess of work the destroyer of the man. He can strike so many blows per day, walk so many steps, breathe so many breaths, produce so much work and live an average, say, of fifty years; he is made ot strike so many blows, to walk so many more steps, to breathe so many more breaths per day, and to increase altogether a fourth of his life. He meets the effort; the result is, that producing for a limited time a fourth more work, he dies at 37 for 50'._

*4. Day-Work and Night-Work. The Shift System*

_367_ Constant capital has to be absorbing labour power constantly; its lying fallow represents a loss for the capitalist and this is why the extension of the working day beyond its natural limits is in the capitalist's interests. Shift work or night-work are two potential solutions since it is impossible for the capitalist to exploit the same workers for an entire day.

_373_ [Footnote with an amazing quote from Hegel: 'In a time so rich in reflection and so devoted to raisonnement as our own, he must be a poor create who cannot advance a good ground for everything, even for what is worst and most depraved. Everything in the world that has become corrupt, has had good ground for its corruption'.]

_375_ The moral dimension of the degredation capitalism visits on the working class, the contradiction between keeping the Sabbath holy and extending working hours.

[Great footnote: ''The amount of work,' say Tremenheere and Tufnell, who drafted the general report, 'done by boys, youths, girls and women in the course of their daily or nightly spell of labour, is certainly extraordinary'. Meanwhile, late at night perhaps, Mr Glass-Capital, stuffed full with abstinence, and primted with port wine, reels home from his club, droning out idiotically, 'Britons never, never shall be slaves!']

[Slavery]

_377_ Slave plantations as extreme instances in which the interests of the worker and those of the capitalist do not coincide to the extent that working them to death is an insignificant overhead cost to absorb.

_378 - 9_ Role of immigrants and labour mobility, effectively the trade in labour-power, in pressing working conditions down.

[Transition]

_380_ Capitalism's dependence on agricultural labourers and the non-industrial population to sustain itself.

_382_ The process by which the agricultural labourer or peasant becomes a 'free labourer', selling their labour power in order to survive, is brutal, traumatic and prolonged, as he says on page 412:

_'The establishment of a normal working day is therefore the product of a protracted and more or less concealed civil war between the capitalist class and the working class'._

_411_ The drive to extract surplus labour takes place first in those sections which were revolutionised by water-power, steam and machinery.

_417_ How the mass of surplus value is calculated relative to the rate.

_418_ It is possible for the rate of surplus value to decrease while the mass of surplus value increases and vice versa.

_419_ [Footnote explaining the idiocy of the idea of supply and demand as an explanation for price, propagated by 'the vulgar economist, who imagines, like an inverted Archimedes, that in the determination of the market price of labour by supply and demand he has found the fulcrum by means of which he cannot so much move the world, as bring it to a standstill'.]
