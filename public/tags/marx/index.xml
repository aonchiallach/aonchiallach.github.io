      <description>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.
This is of course not to suggest that Marxâ€™s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen.</description>
