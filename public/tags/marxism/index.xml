      <description>There is a huge amount of historical material and review of historiographical literature in this work, the emphasis in these notes falls more on the theoretical end
Chapter One Introduction: Themes in Historical Materialism
1 For Marx, a mode of production is a form of domination and control of labour and is bound up with a wider set of class relations expressive of them and their social functions.
Social forms and class divisions specific to the historical phase they belong to arise but equally they are capable of subsuming earlier forms as an intrinsic part of their own development, according to an inherent dynamic that works itself out in capitalism&amp;rsquo;s laws of motion.</description>

      <title>Tom Nairn and Ireland</title>

      <description>A note on terminology: Nairn uses the term &amp;lsquo;Protestants&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;unionists&amp;rsquo; and Ulster rather than &amp;rsquo;the six counties&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Ulster&amp;rsquo;
In the opening paragraphs of &amp;lsquo;Northern Ireland: Portent or Relic&amp;rsquo;, a chapter written on Ireland in The Break-up of Britain (1977), Tom Nairn outlines his understanding of the Troubles. From his point of view it is a conflict taking place between two communities. It is separate from the English government, which has no interest in the region, whether strategic, political or ideological.</description>
