      <title>Tom Nairn and Ireland</title>

      <description>A note on terminology: Nairn uses the term &amp;lsquo;Protestants&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;unionists&amp;rsquo; and Ulster rather than &amp;rsquo;the six counties&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Ulster&amp;rsquo;
In the opening paragraphs of &amp;lsquo;Northern Ireland: Portent or Relic&amp;rsquo;, a chapter written on Ireland in The Break-up of Britain (1977), Tom Nairn outlines his understanding of the Troubles. From his point of view it is a conflict taking place between two communities. It is separate from the English government, which has no interest in the region, whether strategic, political or ideological.</description>

      <description>Capital Markets, Financial Systems and the Postwar International Monetary System
The So-called Capital Markets
8 The global capital markets through which trillions of dollars pass every day should be viewed as a charge on the productive system rather than a source of funds for new production.
9 Credit is lending money to people on the understanding that they will pay the money back later along with something extra, usually in the form of a rate of interest.</description>
