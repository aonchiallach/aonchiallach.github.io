      <description>A note on terminology: Nairn uses the term &amp;lsquo;Protestants&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;unionists&amp;rsquo; and Ulster rather than &amp;rsquo;the six counties&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Ulster&amp;rsquo;.
In the opening paragraphs of his chapter on Ireland Tom Nairn outlines his understanding of the conflict in the six counties. From his point of view it is a conflict between two communities, both of which are separate from Westminster and Leinster House, neither of whom are invested in it going one way or the other.</description>
