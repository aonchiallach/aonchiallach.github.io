      <description>There is a huge amount of historical material and review of historiographical literature in this work, the emphasis in these notes falls more on the theoretical end
Chapter One Introduction: Themes in Historical Materialism
1 For Marx, a mode of production is a form of domination and control of labour and is bound up with a wider set of class relations expressive of them and their social functions.
Social forms and class divisions specific to the historical phase they belong to arise but equally they are capable of subsuming earlier forms as an intrinsic part of their own development, according to an inherent dynamic that works itself out in capitalism&amp;rsquo;s laws of motion.</description>

Chapter One: Commodities
The Two Factors of the Commodity
125 The capitalist economy consists of commodities. A commodity is an object of consumption or of production. It satisfies a need and this need is referred to as the commodity’s use-value.
[126 Footnote cites Locke ‘The natural worth of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities, or serve the conveniences of human life’]</description>

      <description>Chapter One: The Global Commodity
12 Companies based in the West such as Walmart, M&amp;amp;S, Primark have gone to enormous efforts to offshore textile production to Bangladesh in pursuit of lower labour costs. According to trade and financial data however, none of these firms profits or government revenues derived from the labour of the workers who made the goods.
All the goods appear as &amp;lsquo;value-added&amp;rsquo; in the UK and other countries where these goods are consumed.</description>

Introduction
1. Production, Consumption, Distribution, Exchange (Circulation)
(1) Production
Independent Individuals, Eighteenth-century Ideas
83 Begins with a dismissal of the accounts of political economy provided by bourgeois economists who imagine political economy as functioning in the same way as it is represented in Daniel Defoe&amp;rsquo;s novel Robinson Crusoe, as though its basis is the autonomy of the individual.
84 Looking at history the fact that the individual belongs to a far larger social totality is obvious; it is only in the eighteenth century, when production and social relations reach an advanced stage that civil society arises and individuals begin to confront sociality as a means to their own end.</description>

      <description>2: &amp;lsquo;Capital Markets&amp;rsquo;, Financial Systems and the Postwar International Monetary System
The So-called Capital Markets
9 Credit is the lending of money in the expectation that the money will be paid back later along with a bonus or dividend in the form of a rate of interest. This is not necessarily a capitalist mechanism, co-operative societies can issue credit as well as building societies.
10 What makes banks distinct is their use of credit involves the creation of money; banks can be giving overdrafts to everyone in the economy at one time.</description>
