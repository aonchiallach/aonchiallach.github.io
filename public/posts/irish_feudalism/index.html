				<p><em>Duffy, Seán, Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf. Gill Books, 2014.</em></p>
<p><em>4</em> A body of law tracts called the Brehon laws surviving from the 7th - 9th centuries give us a lot of information on medieval Irish society.</p>
<p>In early Ireland individuals did not own land in their own right but as part of a kin-group.</p>
<p>The group that inherited the land was not the modern family, but a four-generation group, the <em>derbfhine</em> comprising male descendants of a common great-grandfather.</p>
<p>Women could inherit movable goods and a life interest in the family if their father had no sons.</p>
<p>The <em>derbfhine</em> held land jointly, which was marked off from that of the neighbouring kin-group by fences and boundary stones, each member having an equal share of he family land. With the passage of each generation the land was re-partitioned between surviving members so each had an equal portion of good and bad land, arable, pasture or bog etc.</p>
<p>As time moved on inheritance came to be confined to a closer male-descent group, the <em>gelfhine</em>, comprising a man, his sons and his son&rsquo;s sons; there is only limited evidence that land was held by large numbers of people in common.</p>
<p><em>5</em> Early medieval Ireland was extremely hierarchical; there was a caste of aristocrats, their dependents and their slaves.</p>
<p>There were different ranks of lord, seven grades of churchmen and seven grades of poet.</p>
<p>Slavery was very common, a person could be born into it, taken as a spoil of war, or condemned to it as punishment for a crime.</p>
<p>The commoner or non-lordly class comprised those who owned or aspired to own land. There were eight different ranks of commoner, the disparity between grades can be seen by the differing &lsquo;honour prices&rsquo; or compensation payable for a legal offence against them.</p>
<p>Thus a man of cultivated land had an honour price of three milch cows, a cow-freeman would be owed two and a half, that of a between-house man, a son yet to acquire his own land, was a two year-old heifer.</p>
<p><em>6</em> Feudalism is a system in which the lords held all the land and granted portions of it as fiefs to their vassals in return for rent or military aid or help with the harvest.</p>
<p>In the Irish system the <em>céle</em> had his own land by inheritance; the lord gave him cattle or other livestock and security. In return the lord could expect meat, butter, cheese, farm labour or entertainment.</p>
<p><em>7</em> The basic unit of political organisation was the <em>túath</em>. While many within the <em>túath</em> were related, there would often have been many who were not related to the <em>túath</em> by blood. In that sense it was not strictly tribal, despite the system of naming <em>túath</em> and other territories after an ancestor.</p>
<p>Brian Bóraime&rsquo;s dynasty was called Dál Cais because it claimed to be the <em>dál</em> of a supposed ancestor called Cass. But this was the name of both teh lineage and the territorial kingdom from which the lineage ruled, not everyone in that territory belonged to the lineage.</p>
<p><em>8</em> Ireland was dominated by political groupings calling themselves the <em>Uí</em> of or the <em>cenél</em> of or the <em>corcu</em> or the <em>dál</em> of.</p>
<p><em>11</em> The language used in these laws is uniform and grammatically standardised; it was written by professional jurists and members of the <em>áes dána</em> whose authority transcended local boundaries; they practiced their occupation across the Irish world.</p>
<p>What comes across in these documents is the degree to which the Irish regarded themselves as a single unified people, a national origin myth present in <em>Lebor Gabála Érenn</em> recounts successive waves of invaders from the time of Cessair to Noah&rsquo;s son Bith to Partholón who fought the Formorian demons to Nemed the Scythian to the <em>Fir Bolg</em> (who may be related to the Continental Celtic tribe Belgae) to the <em>Tuatha Dé Danann</em>, the climax coming with the Milesians, descended from the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, Scota, which gives the island its Latin name.</p>
<p>Her son Goídeal Glas gives his name to the people and their language; which seem to have been derived from the Welsh, Gwyddyl.</p>
<p><em>12</em> Goídeal Glas (or his ancestor Fénius Farsaid) derived the language from all the best bits scattered across the world from the Tower of Babel.</p>
<p>This fixation on genealogy derived from the Bible gave a powerful sense of dynastic solidarity.</p>
<p><em>13</em> The Hill of Tara is 2km in length but never more than 150m high and preserves monuments from the late Stone Age. There are extensive remains from the Bronze and Iron age but little archaeological evidence for its occupation or use during the middle ages.</p>
<p>It features prominently in Irish mythology as a place connected with the the gods of ancient Ireland; when the sons of Míl, the ancestors of the Irish, first arrived in Ireland they confronted the <em>Túatha Dé Danann</em> at Tara and defeated them at nearly Tailtiu, this underlined their claim on Tara and Ireland in general.</p>
<p>On the Hill of Tara there is a stone called the Lia Fáil which cries out beneath the feet of the rightful king of Ireland; the individual concerned did not necessarily ever manage to control each kingdom but he special status was recognised.</p>
<p><em>15</em> The kingship of Tara was monopolised by the Uí Néill, one great dynasty with many sprawling branches, and Tara came to be associated with their attempts to claim hegemony across the island.</p>
<p>Muirchú, who wrote a life of St. Patrick around the year 700, describes the celebrated historical or pseudo-historical figure Niall Noígiallach (&ldquo;Niall of the Nine Hostages&rdquo;) as one who descended from the royal stock of the entire island, which is an exaggeration but indicative of how many dominant lineages traced themselves back to Niall.</p>
<p>Assuming he was real he may have lived in the fifth century and descended from Conn Céthathach (&ldquo;Conn of the Hundred Battles&rdquo;) who is believed to have lived seven generations before Niall, in the late Iron Age.</p>
<p><em>16</em> This dynasty was divided in the southern Uí Néill of the midlands and the Northern Uí Néill, both of which are terms of convenience for competing branches.</p>
<p><em>44</em> Irish churchmen were active on the continent from the seventh century, beginning with Columbanus. They were missionaries but also teachers, grammarians, classicists and philosophers.</p>
<p>Dícúil writes about hermits in the Faroe Islands being harassed by Vikings; indicative of the negative experience of churchmen in north-west Europe when faced with raiding.</p>
<p><em>45</em> Writings also describe their settling areas they raided, setting up sheep pastures, suggesting that more sophisticated social and economic relations than mere rading had developed.</p>
<p>Similarly, patterns of warfare point to more serious territorial wars against an established force.</p>
<p><em>46</em> Certain Scandinavian rulers acquired wealth from trade in slaves and luxury commodities such as walrus-ivory.</p>
<p>The first recorded raid took place in 793 when a monastery founded by Irish monks on Holy Island at Lindisfarne in Northumbria was attacked.</p>
<p>Raids on Ireland began in 795 as either Rathlin or Lambay Island was burned by the Vikings, its shrines were broken and plundered.</p>
<p><em>52</em> In the 830s Ireland was exposed to intensive Scandinavian assault, beginning at Leinster and Southern Uí Néill territory in Brega, with fleets operating in the Boyne, the Liffey, the Shannon, the Erne and Lough Neagh. In 841 the Vikings built a ship-camp in Dublin and another at Linn Duachaill followed by one on Lough Ree.</p>
<p>Their being located permanently in parts of Ireland led to them take sides in Irish wars and becoming vulnerable to Irish resistance; the late 840s saw a string of Irish victories; the King of Osraige Cerball mac Dúnlainge made a name for himself as an opponent of Viking activity in the Barrow Valley, killing 1,200 Vikings. The following year Máel Sechnaill killed 700 in a battle at Skreen, the combined forces of Munster and Leinster killed 200 or 1,200 near Castledermot.</p>
<p>The Frankish Annals of St-Bertin record the following year a delegation arrived at the court of Charlemagne&rsquo;s grandson Charles the Bald bearing gifts from presumably Máel Sechnaill, announcing the vanquishing of the heathens by the Irish.</p>
<p><em>53</em> Unclear whether Irish military tactics adapted, viking disunity provoked some to join the Irish side or if Iceland presented a more appealing prospect for unsettled land.</p>
<p><em>55</em> In any case, Uí Néill&rsquo;s success in repelling an invasion was a significant achievement.</p>
