      <description>This book emerges from George Saundersâ€™ experience leading a class in Syracuse University on writing the short story form. The texts which have shaped his understanding, as laid out here, are all Russian. Seven stories from Chekhov, Gogol, Tolstoy and Turgenev appear in the edition, followed by a chapter in which Saunders lays out the lessons it offers.
I have never undertaken an MFA programme but I have attended a couple of creative writing classes both in and out of a university context.</description>
