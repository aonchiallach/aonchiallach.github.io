      <description>(Political reading of an episode late into James Joyce&amp;rsquo;s novel Ulysses. It&amp;rsquo;s very academic, I wrote it intending it to form part of the doctoral thesis, but it did not make the final cut.)
‘Eumaeus’ is Ulysses‘ (1922) third last episode and is written in a style manifestly distinct from the rest of the novel. This is due to its functioning, I contend, as a parody of nineteenth century realism, of which someone like Charles Dickens might be said to be a standard-bearer, an author whose works Eumaeus both references and satirises.</description>
