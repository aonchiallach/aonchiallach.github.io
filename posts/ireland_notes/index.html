				<p><em>Coakley, Maurice. Ireland in the World Order: A History of Uneven Development. Pluto Press, 2012</em></p>
<p><em>6</em> The socio-political evolution of Leinster, Munster and England in the eleventh and twelfth centuries seem similar; both were conquered by French-speaking knights who established a seignoral social order and manorial economy based on intensive arable agriculture as opposed to pastoral husbandry, an extensive trade network and urban development, consolidating the market towns the Vikings had establishing along the coast under the English monarch.</p>
<p><em>7</em> The Anglo-French aristocracy established military supremacy across most of the island; Gaelic power was confined to the west and mountainous, boggy parts of the south and east and even then often subordinate to a feudal lord.</p>
<p><em>9</em> A substantial English artisan, merchant and peasant community began to develop the eastern and southern cities.</p>
<p><em>11</em> The 1366 Statutes of Kilkenny were not directed solely against the indigenous Irish community but also people of English descent who could not speak Egnlish; any English person who did not speak English was given six months to learn it or they would forfeit their Church appointments; these laws were also directed against Irish customs, dress, sport, names.</p>
<p><em>12</em> This is indicative of a certain amount of anxiety regarding the Anglo-French aristocracy (hereafter referred to as the Old English) becoming Gaelicised.</p>
<p>Coakley also links this to a broader crisis of European feudalism; the productive capacity of medieval agriculture being reached, feudal lords facing increasing costs which they attempted to pass onto the peasantry.</p>
<p><em>14</em> The Black Death reached Ireland in 1348; it hit more developed Anglicised areas much harder, this strengthened the position of the peasantry against the lords and further undermined the position of the Normans in the cities who depended on trade.</p>
<p><em>15</em> This encouraged them to establish trade relationships with the indigenous population, despite this being illegal; Gaelic forms of pastoral farming re-asserted themselves against agrarianism.</p>
<p><em>19 - 20</em> Over time Normans began to enter into marriage alliances with Gaelic chiefs. Some Gaelicised lords abandoned all loyalty to the crown, some did not. A syncretic form of law drawing from English, Brehon and French traditions began to arise.</p>
<p>This is at once an example of political, economic and legal formations following economic ones and within this there are more pragmatic aims; serves the purpose of reducing cattle raids and the instability which would have followed were adherence to English laws of primogeniture not abandoned.</p>
<p>By the fifteenth century English documents begin to refer to the &lsquo;degenerate English&rsquo; in Ireland.</p>
<p><em>21</em> The lowland region around Dublin, &rsquo;the Pale&rsquo;, was the only place in Ireland that an English-style gentry emerged, but it too diverged from the English model; though it was the only place arable farming was happening in Ireland there was no properous yeomanry existing between the landowners and the broader peasantry.</p>
<p><em>26 - 7</em> From the thirteenth century on Gaelic chiefs began building castles, first of wood then stone. They also recruited Norse-Gaelic mercenaries from the Scottish islands, indicating their growing capacity to mobilise resources outside of their kin groups.</p>
<p><em>35</em> The expansion of militaries in the early modern era facilitated the emergence of state bureaucracies, rendered nation states more coherent.</p>
<p><em>36</em> State centralisation and religious reform were part of the same process in Ireland; this was an attempt to subordinate autonomous Gaelic communities beneath English law.</p>
<p><em>37</em> One of the means of doing so was &lsquo;surrender and re-grant&rsquo; whereby the chiefs would surrender their land and have it granted under the authority of the British monarch.</p>
<p><em>41</em> This programme was implemented largely through coercion; the arl of Kildare, who owned the richest agricultural land in Ireland, was executed and garrison were built across the country.</p>
<p><em>41</em> The social order was further undermined by the Brits backing some Gaelic chiefs in internecine conflict against others.</p>
<p><em>44 - 7</em> Coakley argues the Reformation caught on in Europe because it provided an internal and impersonal answer to the collapse of feudal customs. [We also know it served as a superstructural response to / legitimation of the dissolution of bonds of kinship, productive limits and moral law in usury, land ownership]</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take outside of urban areas in Ireland because these bonds of kinship were still strong, there was a persisting paganism in Catholic practices [this is often over-stated] and because it became identified with military conquest.</p>
<p><em>51 - 74</em> Coakley attributes the distinct developmental patterns of Ireland, Wales and Scotland to the less aristocratic character of its Norman settlers and a strong Gaelic literary tradition.</p>
<p><em>79</em> Programmes of dispossession and plantation prompted the 1641 rebellion, which began as an elite revolt and then spread across the country.</p>
<p>It overlapped with the English Revolution during which a new agrarian and colonial merchant elite was asserting itself against the monarchy and seeking support for the Protestant cause in Europe.</p>
<p><em>80</em> A faction the London mercantile elite led by Oliver Cromwell helped to finance an army to travel to Ireland to suppress the Irish revolt.</p>
<p><em>81</em> Historians have increasingly moved away from racialised accounts of why Ireland failed to industrialise in favour of an abscence of material resources such as coal. Coakley makes the point that peat was readily available, as was fixed capital in the railways along with cheap forms of maritime transport.</p>
<p><em>82</em> Denis O&rsquo;Hearn puts forward the classic model of colonial underdevelopment; English-imposed trade and manufacturing restrictions crippling native industry and preventing the development of a mercantile stratum, but Coakley criticises his focus on the external at the expense of the internal, insisting on Scotland as a point of comparison.</p>
<p><em>84 - 7</em> Scottish agrarianism developed along English lines; higher rents were imposed, collective land use was rolled back, it had a bigger urban population than Ireland and more merchants in the colonial trade. Scottish Enlightenment also disseminated ideas about agricultural improvement.</p>
<p><em>89</em> Imposition of capitalism by these same means was resisted to a greater extent in Ireland [it was also resisted in Scotland]</p>
<p><em>92 - 4</em> Another reason is that the Penal Laws prevented the emergence of a yeoman class, except in Ulster, where landlords allowed their tenants greater opportunity for capital accumulation, Coakley refers to this as &lsquo;Ulster custom&rsquo;, which made small-scale capital accumulation for an entrepreneurial layer of peasantry possible.</p>
<p><em>95</em> Meandering consideration of why the Anglo-Irish never became hegemonic outside of certain parts of Ulster [Because of colonialism!!]</p>
