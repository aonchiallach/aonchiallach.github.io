<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><em>12</em> The Ottomans officially surrendered to the British inside Jerusalem&rsquo;s walled Old City on 9 December 1917.</p>
<p>This ended four centuries of Ottoman imperial rule.</p>
<p>Palestine owed its name to the Romans; to Muslims it was home to Jerusalem&rsquo;s al-Aqsa mosque (the third most sacred site after Mecca and Medina) from where the Prophet Muhammed ascended to heaven.</p>
<p><em>13</em> Locally it was regarded as part of Bilad al-Sham (Greater Syria) today roughly Syria, Lebanon and the Levant.</p>
<p>It had not been a separate unit since Sultan Selim I had defeated the Mamluk rulers of Syria and Egypt in 1517.</p>
<p>It was divided into <em>sanjaqs</em> or districts ruled from the provinces of Damascus or Beirut.</p>
<p>In 1872 Jerusalem, along with the <em>sanjaqs</em> of Nablus and Acre formed the region commonly referred to as Southern Syria or Palestine.</p>
<p>The principal Christian denominations regarded Palestine as a separate entity; in Arabic it was called <em>al-ard al-Muqaddasah</em> - the Holy Land. The Hebrew <em>Eretz haKodesh</em> had the same meaning.</p>
<p>Palestine was bordered by the east by the river Jordan and the Dead Sea, in the west by the Mediterranean, and after a British-Ottoman agreement in 1906, by a marked frontier with Egypt.</p>
<p>On the eve of the first World War the primary identity of its majority Arab-speaking population Muslim population was local as well as Palestinian but not in a manner than demanded independence from the sultan. A small elite which advocated autonomy within the Ottoman Empire held to the notion that there was a single Arab nation united by a common language and culture.</p>
<p>Christians were influenced by notions of nationalism and patriotism they derived from missionary schools.</p>
<p>Palestinian identity was also developing in opposition to the Zionist movement, which had been growing since the 1880s.</p>
<p>On 2 November 1917 Lord Balfour, Britain&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary wrote to Lord Rothschild of the World Zionist Organisation informing him that the Brits favoured the establishment of a national homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine.</p>
<p>In doing so Lloyd George wanted to outsmart the French in postwar operations in the Levant and grasp the opportunity to use Palestine&rsquo;s strategic location to protect Egpyt, the Suez Canal as well as the passage to India. An additional calculation may have been its propaganda value in Russia and the US, its consequences for Sykes-Picot agreement between Britain, France and Russia with regard to post-war spheres of influence in West Asia and pledges about Arab independence made by the Brits in 1915 to encourage Sharif Hussein to launch his revolt against the Turks.</p>
<p><em>16</em> Balfour stipulated that nothing be done to violate the rights of existing non-Jewish communities which formed 90% of Palestine&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>This clause was in place due to the objections of Lord Curzon, former viceroy of India, predicting Arab discontent at their being expropriated and disenfranchised by Zionist settlement.</p>
<p><em>17</em> Ottoman conscription had taken a heavy toll on the Arab population of 700,000; food, animals and fuel were in short supply due to the acquisitions of the Turkish military. Starvation rations and disease were the norm.</p>
<p>In 1915 poor harvests and a plague of locusts added to the impact of the Allied naval blockade of Palestinian and Syrian ports.</p>
<p>The Jewish population - 59,000 on the eve of the war - was depleted by emigration and deportation of enemy nationals, especially Russians. Some took Ottoman citizenship, leading Zionists were jailed, Arab nationalists were hanged.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Expeditionary Force began an assault on Gaza in March 1917. In April the civilian populations of Jaffa and Tel Aviv were ordered to leave. Beersheba and Gaza were captured in October and November.</p>
<p><em>18</em> C.P. Scott&rsquo;s view that the Palestinians were uncivilised is presented as representative of European opinion, as is the suggestion that they would benefit from the Zionist project.</p>
<p><strong>1882 - 1917</strong></p>
<p><em>19</em> In 1918 the British military administration counted 512,000 Muslims, 66,000 Jews and 61,000 Christians.</p>
<p>The Arabs were largely peasants, artisans and in the countryside where Bedouin tribes roamed, overwhelmingly illiterate. Large tracts of land were in the hands of absentee owners. Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa were the urban centres.</p>
<p>By 1918 some 15,000 Jewish newcomers were living in 45 rural colonies that made up the new Zionist camp, which was distinct from the 50,000 strong old Jewish community.</p>
<p><em>20</em> Jews had always been in Palestine. Over the previous century Ashkenazi Jews, mostly Russian or Eastern European, had come to study and pray, subsisting on charitable contributions in Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias and Safed, where they mourned the destruction of the Temple.</p>
<p>The majority came after 1840 after the Ottomans defeated a rebellion by the Egyptian Pasha Muhammed Ali. A minority were native-born Sephardi or Mizrahi Jews, whose ancestors were from Spain, North Africa, the Balkans. Many spoke Arabic or Ladino; their identity was religious, but not national, most were Ottoman citizens.</p>
<p>Relations between Christians, Muslims and Jews were not contentious, they lived under the Ottoman system of communal religious autonomy under the sultan in Istanbul. Inequalities existed in status and taxation but there was tolerance in mixed neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem Ashkenazi formed a majority, speaking a Palestinian variant of Yiddish, the vernacular of the Russian &lsquo;Pale of Settlement&rsquo; but replete with Arabic words.</p>
<p>Sephardim were culturally closer to Muslims than Christians.</p>
<p>Palestine&rsquo;s connections with the wider world had deepened in the mid nineteenth century thanks to Ottoman reforms, European investment and the expansion of trade and communication. European consulates had been established in the years after the Crimean War in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa to deal with Christian pilgrims and increasing missionary activity. Economic growth driven by exports of wheat and citrus fruit boosted the population in coastal cities.</p>
<p><em>21</em> Zionism proper begins with the outbreak of large-scale pogroms in the Russian Empire. The first settlers called themselves <em>Hovevi Tzion</em> (Lovers of Zion), a network of groups who sought to forge a Jewish national life in Palestine and use the Hebrew language rather than Yiddish.</p>
<p><em>22</em> In theory the Ottoman authorities were hostile to settlers but in practice the administration was vulnerable to bribes.</p>
<p>Settlers depended on Arab labour for transport, supplies and fertiliser.</p>
<p><em>24</em> Disputes arose over the demarcation of land boundaries and grazing rights with farmers dispossessed by sale who had been working land for absentee landlords. In 1886 riots broke out in Petah Tikvah after a Jewish farmer confiscated Arab-owned donkeys grazing on his land.</p>
<p>By 1889 Zichron had 1,200 Arab agricultural workers serving 200 Jews. In Rishon LeZion 40 Jewish families attracted 300 Arab families to work as migrant labourers; they were cheaper, more expendable and more hard-working than Jewish immigrants from Europe.</p>
<p>Arab objections begann to take on a more overtly political character.</p>
<p><em>25</em> In 1891 the Arabs urged an end to Jewish immigration and land purchases, but Arab notables continued to sell their land; prices were high.</p>
<p><em>26</em> Theodore Herzl, the Viennesse journalist who founded Zionism knew v little about life in Ottoman Palestine. His quest for a Jewish homeland began in the wake of the Dreyfus affair in France.</p>
<p>In 1896 he published <em>Der Judenstaat</em> (the Jewish State), which referred to Palestine and Argentina as two countries which would be suitable on the basis of their history as &rsquo;experiments in colonisation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The first Zionist Congress, held in Basel in 1897, founded the Zionist Organisation whose goal was a publicly recognised legally secured home in Palestine for Jewish people. At this stage there was eighteen new colonies in the country and the Ottomans appointed an official committee to examine land purchase activity; sales were halted for the next few years. Herzl visited Palestine two months later, his diary makes no reference to the Arab residents.</p>
<p>Arab hostility was becoming more evident around the turn of the century; the eviction of peasants from land purchased in Galilee by the Jewish Colonisation Association (JCA) led to attacks on Jewish surveyors.</p>
<p>By 1904 5,500 settlers were living in 25 agricultural colonies in 3 blocs; in eastern Upper Galilee, south of Haifa and south-east of Jaffa. This year the authorities banned the sale of land to foreign Jews.</p>
<p><em>29</em> The immigration and colonisation effort was better co-ordinated from 1908 onwards, the year the Young Turk revolution overthrew the Sultan. The Zionist Organisation set up its first premises in Palestine, to supplement the Zionist office in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Instances in which Jewish settlers were attacked and their farms pillages increased significantly.</p>
<p><em>30</em> Local opposition also came from Sephardic Jews who called on Zionists to embrace Arab rather than import European culture, but they had little influence.</p>
<p><em>33</em> Even as Arabs were being kicked off their lands Zionists emphasised the benefits which would accrue to them through settlement; through the creation of jobs, productive use being made of the land, etc.</p>
<p>Calls to replace Arab labourers by Jews, even at a higher cost to employers, increased after the second <em>aliya</em> (&lsquo;ascent&rsquo; or &lsquo;wave of immigration&rsquo;) in 1904; which included Russian socialists, among them David Gruen, born in Poland, who Hebraized his name to Ben-Gurion.</p>
<p>A group of Russian Jews from the Marxist <em>Poalei Zion</em> movement formed <em>HaShomer</em> (The Watchmen on Guard), to replace Arab settlement guards, which became the vanguard of a radical Zionist frontier ethos.</p>
<p><em>34</em> This new mentality, which was behind attacks on Arab workers and Jewish farmers who employed them, was praised by Zionist writers.</p>
<p>Between 1882 and 1909 thirteen Jews were killed by Arabs, but only two were politically motivated; from this point on politicaly motivated killings increase, generally in the wake of evictions.</p>
<p>This consolidated racist and anti-Arab attitudes among Zionists, though there were some who spoke publically about a co-operative model of settlement.</p>
<p><strong>1917 - 1929</strong></p>
<p><em>39</em> Sephardi had been encouraged to severe contacts with Arabs after intimidation from Ashkenazim.</p>
<p>In June 1918 Chaim Weizmann travelled to Aqaba in Transjordan to meet Emir Faisal, the third son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca and commander of the Arab forces that had fought the Turks with British support. Weizmann had a dismissive attitude to the Palestinians, but admired Faisal; his objective in meeting him was to &rsquo;localise the Arab question&rsquo;, use Jewish influence in the US to assist Arab nationalists in return for their support or non-involvement in Zionist affairs.</p>
<p>In January 1919 they signed an agreement, the fourth article of which laid out how all measures shall be taken to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale. It stipulated that Arab farmer rights would be respected and all Islamic holy sites would remain under Arab control.</p>
<p>However, with French and British control across the region, this agreement was a dead letter.</p>
<p>Ben-Gurion, leader of the Labour Unity movement was the foremost pessimist with regard to a strategy of co-operation with Arabs: saw clearly that it was a zero-sum game.</p>
<p><em>40</em> In March 1920 the settlements of Metullah and Tel Hai were attacked; a cult of martyrdom began to develop among the settlers.</p>
<p><em>42-3</em> Zionists complained the Brits were not acting against the Palestinians, but Jewish representatives were assured there would be sufficient security during the Nebi Musa pilgrimage near Jericho in April. In the event, three days of violence left 5 Jews dead and 200 injured, 4 Arabs killed and 25 injured. The right-wing militant Zionist Vladimir Jabotinsky, who had served in the British Army during the war and had led Jewish efforts, was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude; this service was reduced to a year.</p>
<p>A distinct Palestinian national identity began to take shape; in February 1919 the first congress of Muslim-Christian Associations (MCA) declared unity with Syria though this support faded when Faisal&rsquo;s rule collapsed, he was expelled by the French the following summer and there was suspicion after his deal with Weizmann.</p>
<p>In May 1920 the San Remo conference granted Britain the Mandate for Palestine under the League of Nations; Syria, including Lebanon and Mesopotamia (Iraq) were to be recognised as provisionally independent but in reality were under the yoke of Britain and France &lsquo;until such a time as they are able to stand alone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Transjordan was briefly a no-man&rsquo;s-land until being attached to the British Palestine Mandate but was exempted from Balfour&rsquo;s pledge under the rule of Faisal&rsquo;s brother, Emir Abdullah bin Hussein; the Arab Peninsula remained a battleground between Sharif Hussein and the Al Saud.</p>
<p><em>44</em> Britain&rsquo;s first high commissioner for Palestine was Sir Herbert Samuel, a leading liberal Jewish politician.</p>
<p>The Mandate incorporated the Balfour Declaration almost verbatim; English, Arabic and Hebrew were declared official languages. A &lsquo;Jewish Agency&rsquo; was created to advise the administration but no such agency was in place for Arabs; the document did not even use the word &lsquo;Arab&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In December 1920 the MCA&rsquo;s third Palestinian Congress in Haifa dropped its demand for union with Syria and rejected the Balfour declaration. It elected an Arab Executive (AE) committee led by Musa Kazem al-Husseini of the eminent Jerusalem family. Palestinians began to focus more on Palestine, publishing works of geography and history.</p>
<p><em>45</em> Chaim Kalvarisky, a Polish-born and French educated land agent in Galilee, was tasked by the Zionist executive to promote a Muslim National Association to compete with the MCA.</p>
<p>Other plans to buy off Arab opposition failed due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p><em>46</em> Lawyer Awni Abdel-Hadi of Nablus wrote that he preferred dealing with Zionists who did not seek rapproachement as they are more open about their motives.</p>
<p>In May 1921 violence erupted in Jaffa.</p>
<p><em>47</em> Over six days of violence 41 Jews and 44 Arabs were killed.</p>
<p>Sir Herbert Samuel called for a halt to Jewish immigration which infuriated the Zionists; fines and other collective punishments were imposed on the Arabs.</p>
<p><em>48</em> A volunteer Zionist defense organisation was set up called the <em>Haganah</em> (Defence). Arms were smuggled in, intelligence-gathering on Arabs was initiated, Jabotinsky campaigned for for the revival of Jewish battalions who fought in WWI and their incorporation into the British garrison in Palestine.</p>
<p>A British report notes the almost complete breakdown in relations between formerly friendly Jews and Arabs.</p>
<p><em>49</em> The Zionist enterprise had begun four decades ago but had not not yet brought about a significant demographic transformation; Palestine&rsquo;s 757,000 inhabitants were overwhelmingly Arab, with a Jewish minority of 83,000 or 11% of the population. The third <em>aliya</em>, from 1919 - 23 brought in 35,000 Russian, Polish newcomers, who played an important role in establishing <em>kubbutzim</em> and other collection Zionist organisations; they built roads, drained swamps and undertook other public construction projects.</p>
<p><em>50</em> Employing Arabs was increasingly frowned upon.</p>
<p>The fourth <em>aliya</em> is dated from 1924 - 29, the majority were Polish, escaping waves of anti-Semetic persecution.</p>
<p>Weizmann looked down on this new generation of immigrants; in comparison to previous generations of ideologically motivated pioneers this cohort was less interested in embarking on a settler colonial project.</p>
<p><em>53</em> Land purchases expanded and more Jewish settlements were established along the coastal plain.</p>
<p>The annual conference of <em>Ahdut haAvoda</em>, held at one of the first <em>kibbutzim</em> at Ein Harod concluded that the future of the state depended on the joint organisation of Israeli and Arab workers, as there was no Arab national movement and political agreement with them was impossible. Ben-Gurion spoke out against representative government.</p>
<p><em>54</em> When a new organisation <em>Brit Shalom</em> was established in order to foster dialogue and co-operation between Arabs and Jews and promote a bi-national state it was met with hostility from the Zionist establishment.</p>
<p>The Arabs declared a general strike when Lord Balfour, along with Weizmann and Field Marshall Alleby attended its inauguration.</p>
<p><em>55</em> Nashashibi&rsquo;s Palestinian Arab National Party favoured co-operation with the British administration and were denounced as traitors by the Arab Executive. Zionists took advantage of divisions among the Arabs to the point of financially supporting one side against the other.</p>
<p>Land purchases began to edge out traditional farming methods in cereal cultivation and herding.</p>
<p><em>56</em> A dispute developed over the western wall of the Herodian temple compound in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City, which Jews believed was the site of the Temple of Soloman. It is also the Western wall of the Haram al-Sharif known to Muslims as <em>al-Buraq</em>, named after the horse the Prophet Muhammed had tethered there before ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>Under the Ottomans the Jews were not permitted to place benches, screens or do anything which might lay claim to possession though in practice these edicts were often ignored. Little changed under the Brits. In 1922 the Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) opposed any attempt to enhance Jewish access and Haj Amin, the Grand Mufti, raised a large amount of money to renovate the Haram.</p>
<p><em>57</em> This dispute escalated on Yom Kippur 1928 when Jews brought a screen to separate male and female worshipers, which was removed by police. The SMC started a campaign to tighten restrictions. On 16 August a Kurdish Jewish teenager was stabbed to death</p>
<p><em>58</em> The biggest Arab attack in response to this news took place in Hebron, home of the Tomb of the Patriarchs and the Ibrahimi mosque. Sixty-four victims from the city&rsquo;s Orthodox Jewish community.</p>
<p><em>59</em> In June 1930 three Arabs, convicted of murder in Hebron and similar disturbances in Safed were hanged in Acre prison; vigils were held in Haifa and Nablus; by contrast, the Jewish policeman who killed an entire Arab family in Jaffa had his death sentence commuted.</p>
<p><em>61</em> A British White Paper produced in 1930 implied that future Jewish immigration to Palestine might have to be restricted due to the growing crisis in Arab landholding, exacerbated by Jewish boycotts.</p>
<p><em>63</em> Ben-Gurion, now a powerful figure in the labour movement, spoke about the irreconcilable ambitions of Arabs and Zionists and emphasised the need to continue immigration and secure the gaps between existing settlement.</p>
<p>After the violence of 1929 there was a marked increase in physical separation in the cities; with Arabs moving to move Arab-dominated areas and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>1929 - 36</strong></p>
<p><em>66</em> By 1931 Jews, numbering 175,000, still constituted less than 17% of the country&rsquo;s population. In December the Grand Mufti Hai Amin al-Husseini convened an Islamic conference in Jerusalem to warn of a Jewish threat to Muslim holy places, Arab newspapers warned of the selling of land and shamed those who did.
In 1930 British policemen pulled down Bedouin tents to clear the land for Jewish settlers. This ended with the eviction of 1,200 Bedouin and began the practice of renaming the area in Hebrew.</p>
<p>Attempts to set up a fund to compete with the Zionists failed.</p>
<p><em>67</em> Frustration with shortcomings in Arab leadership lead to the formation of the pan-Arab Istiqlal (Independence Party), by Awni Abdel-Hadi in 1932, part of a trend which saw Palestinian political life move away from the great aristocratic and merchant families to a younger generation of nationalist activists, often journalists and teachers, who had benefited from a European education and were influenced by Gandhi&rsquo;s struggle against the British in India.</p>
<p>Party activity was centred in Haifa and its party programme was directed towards econonomic independence and the toppling of the British Mandate on the basis that Zionism would collapse with it.</p>
<p>Akram Zuwayter, a leading figure in the party, resigned his post as a teacher in a government school in Acre. Mayors and other Arab officials came under pressure to resign too. A National Congress of Arab Youth patrolled the Mediterranean coastline to prevent illegal Jewish immigrants from landing, underlining that the Mandate was not enforcing its own laws; Jews made up nearly a third of the population in 1936.</p>
<p><em>68</em> Under pressure from the radicals the Arab Executive called a general strike against British policy. In Jaffa in October 1933 police opened fire on demonstrators and killed 26 Arabs, injured ~200. Protests followed in Nablus, Haifa and Gaza.</p>
<p><em>71</em> Secret military organisations such as the <em>Jihad al-Muqaddas</em> (Holy War) led by Abdul-Qader al-Husseini, the son of Musa Kazem and the Mufti&rsquo;s nephew were formed. By 1934 it had collected financial contributions and some firearms.</p>
<p>Other smaller groups followed a similar path, obtaining arms by clandestine means and entering into military training.</p>
<p>The best-known group, known as the Black Hand, was led by Shiekh Izzedin al-Qassam, a Syrian-born preacher, who urged Bedouin to resist settlement by armed methods.</p>
<p><strong>1936 - 9</strong></p>
<p><em>74</em> On 15 April 1936 three armed Arabs forced vehicles passing the road near Nur Shams to stop and give them money to buy weapons and ammunition. They shot three Jews they held up, two of whom died.</p>
<p>The following day two members of a Zionist organisation killed two Arab labourers in a shack near Petah Tiikvah.</p>
<p><em>75</em> Riots spread to Jaffa in the 19th, with nine Jews killed and sixty injured. Curfews were imposed by the police and troops, strikes spread across Arab areas, led by local national committees, clubs and unions.</p>
<p>The Husseini and Nashashibi families, under pressure, dropped their rivalry and formed a new Arab Higher Committee (AHC) under the Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini which called for a general strike, civil disobedience and non-payment of taxes.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the great rebellion, during which crops were burned and there was shooting at Zionist vehicles. Bombs went off in Haifa and Jaffa and the railway line to Egypt was sabotaged near Gaza.</p>
<p><em>76</em> In August 1936 Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Lebanese veteran of the struggle against the French arrived at the head of a five-hundred strong band of Syrians, Iraqis and Palestinians to try and consolidate the rebel force into an army.</p>
<p><em>77</em> Zionists represented the rebels as bandits, used the strike to get rid of Arab workers in the ports and quarries.</p>
<p><em>78</em> Two hundred buildings were destroyed in Jaffa to clear the way for the British military; leaving 6,000 Arabs homeless.</p>
<p>The strike ended in October 1936 when British efforts orchestrated an appeal by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Transjordan and Yemen.</p>
<p><em>80</em> The Peel Report, produced by former secretary for India, presented partition as the only solution, with the Jewish state covering 25% of Palestine, north from Tel Aviv along the coast including the overwhelmingly Arab Galilee.</p>
<p>The Arab state would encompass the mountains and the Negev desert, as well as Jaffa, and be linked to Transjordan. Britain would continue to control Jerusalem, Bethlehem and a corridor to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>This provoked debate in the Zionist movement as it did not include Jerusalem, Hebron or Judea; Jabotinsky insisted the plan was absurd while Weizmann and Ben-Gurion called for more territory.</p>
<p>The Arab Higher Committee dismissed any idea of partitioning the land, prayers were made in public against partition.</p>
<p><em>81</em> The AHC repeated its demands for an end to Jewish immigration and purchases, and for the replacement of a Mandate with a treaty between British and a sovereign and independent Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Negotiations taking place between Arab and Zionist agencies stalled when the Zionists rejected the idea of Bedouins and illiterate Arabs having the same democratic rights as &lsquo;sophisticated&rsquo; European Jews.</p>
<p>Attacks on British military targets began again in September 1937, blamed on al-Qassam supporters.</p>
<p><em>82</em> The Arab Higher Committee and national committee were proscribed and dozens were arrested. Haj Amin al-Husseini was removed from the presidency of the Supreme Muslim Council and went into exile in Lebanon. Other Arab leaders, including the Mayor of Jerusalem Hussein Khalidi were deported to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>In October Arabs attacks buses, railways, the Iraqi pipeline and army posts. Armed groups formed into larger regional units which competed for support from Damascus, where the AHC had established the Central Committee for Jihad under Izzat Darwaza, which collected money and sent supplies and weapons to the Palestinian rebels. The French authorities declined British pressure to interfere.</p>
<p><em>83</em> British policeman from the time:</p>
<p>&lsquo;running over an Arab is the same as a dog in England except we do not report it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Tegart, a colonial policeman, also a veteran of India recommended the construction of concrete forts across the country, the introduction of Doberman dogs from South Africa for use in searches and the opening of an Arab interrogation centre in Jerusalem where waterboarding and other forms of torture were common.</p>
<p>The revolt peaked in August with 9 - 10,000 rebels, 3,000 of whom were full-time fighters. British forces consisted of two army divisions; 25,000 servicemen. The British administered collective punishment on Arab villages, demanding fines, razing houses, confiscating livestock, uprooting trees. Arabs were made to act as human shields by sitting on inspection trolleys which drove on the railways ahead of trains or forced to ride on lorries with army convoys. Once the journey was over the lorry would brake hard to throw the victim off and then run over him, either maiming or killing him. A squaddie:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there was any land mines it was them [the Arab prisoners] that hit them. Rather a dirty trick, but we enjoyed it&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>84</em> Until the winter of 1937 there were few instances of Jews attacking Arabs due to a lack of military capacity or experience.</p>
<p><em>85</em> Anti-Arab attacks began to be carried out by the National Military Organisation, the militant group inspired by Jabotinsky.</p>
<p>In April 1938 Shlomo Ben-Yosef, a member of the Revisionist youth movement, fired at an Arab bus in Galilee. When Ben-Yosef was hanged by the Brits, the Irgun kidnapped and hanged an Arab in Haifa and, using Mizrahi Jews disguised as Arabs, placed bombs in markets and public places, killing at least thirty-five Arabs in an attack in July.</p>
<p><em>86</em> In 1938 a commission of inquiry headed by Sir John Woodhead arrived in Jerusalem to investigate the unrest and review prospects for partition, deciding Peel&rsquo;s proposals were not workable; three alternative partition schemes were arrived at with different boundaries and administrative arrangements; none of them were acceptable to either Zionists or Arabs and recommended the future of the country be reviewed at a London conference.</p>
<p>The AHC opposed co-operation with the commission, those who agreed to come forward were executed or sentenced to death by revolutionary courts in absentia.</p>
<p><em>87</em> A counter-insurgency campaign was ramped up with the help of Fakhri Abdel-Hadi, a former rebel commander from Arrabeh on the Brits&rsquo; payroll.</p>
<p>The rebellion was ultimately put down by air superiority as well as anti-rebel peasant formations in Nablus and among the Druze of Mount Carmel around Haifa. Peace bands were rounded up at rallies with the view to spreading the message that the vast majority of Arabs did not support an uprising.</p>
<p><em>88</em> New settlements were more militaristic as Zionists became more militarily experienced; 3,000 Jews were recruited into the supernumerary police by October 1936. By summer 1939 22,000 Jews were serving in it.</p>
<p><em>89</em> Haganah men joined a new British unit called the Special Night Squads (SNS), established after the Iraqi pipeline had been sabotaged. They led a brutal campaign of counter-insurgency, involving whipping, torture and executions.</p>
<p><em>90</em> The Brits&rsquo; White Paper in May abandoned partition but restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine to 75,000 over the next five years with subsequent figures depending on Arab consent, placed restrictions on the right of Jews to buy land.</p>
<p>It also provided for the creation of an independent Palestinian state in ten years and the immediate appointment of Palestinians to the head of certain industries, made clear that it did not wish to construct a Jewish state against the wishes of the majority of the people in the area.</p>
<p>The Zionists obviously rejected it, the majority of the members of the AHC approved but the exiled mufti rejected.</p>
<p><strong>6: 1939 - 45</strong></p>
<p><em>94</em> 5,000 Palestinians had been killed in the counter-insurgency campaign, 146 hanged and thousands detained. Thousands of homes were demolished, leaders of the Arab Higher Committee were in exile or in jail.</p>
<p>Ben-Gurion pledged to fight the White Paper, with its restrictions on immigration, land purchases and minority status for Jews.</p>
<p><em>98</em> The Biltmore Programme, developed in a hotel of the same name in Manhattan called for unrestricted Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Israel, its programme did not mention the Arab population.</p>
<p>The Zionists worked to influence USian opinion against the Brits.</p>
<p><em>100 - 1</em> Zionist intelligence organisations began to organise around the Jewish Agency and the Haganah.</p>
<p>Spying, collecting information on Arab villages, political allegiances and activity.</p>
<p>Hikes were organised among young Jews for this purpose; presented as an innocent youthful activity but in reality an intelligence gathering operation.</p>
<p><em>103</em> This data was exploited for land purchases, sometimes paid Palestinian informants were used as middlemen to encourage the Palestinians to part with their cash.</p>
<p>Information was collected on Arab landholders who were in debt.</p>
<p><strong>1945 - 49</strong></p>
<p><em>105 - 6</em> Series of attacks by Palestinian rebels and Zionist militias escalate.</p>
<p>In October 1945 the Haganah and Irgun launched a co-ordinated rebellion against Tan rule by sabotaging the railway system. In April 1946 the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry recommended the country be governed under bi-national principles and that 100,000 Jewish refugees enter the country.</p>
<p>In June another <em>Haganah</em> operation destroyed all bridges connecting Palestine to neighbouring countries. 2,700 Jews were rounded up by the Brits including most Jewish agency leaders and a large part of the Haganah command.</p>
<p>Three weeks later the Irgun blew up the King David Hotel, the headquarters of the British administration, killing 91 people about third of whom were Jewish.</p>
<p><em>107</em> The Brits kicked the question of the state to a UN-appointed Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), the Palestinians refused to participate.</p>
<p>In September seven of the UNs ten members recommended partition with international status for Jerusalem. The minority (India, Iran and Yugoslavia) proposed a federal state with Jerusalem as capital.</p>
<p>Intense Zionist lobbying secured a majority of 33 to 13 with ten abstentions.</p>
<p>UN Resolution 181 was backed by the US and the USSR, it was opposed by Palestinians and Arab states.</p>
<p>The proposed Jewish state was to consist of 55% of the country, including the unpopulated Negev desert. Its population would comprise 500,000 Jews and 400,000 Arabs.</p>
<p>At this point Jews owned 7% of Palestine&rsquo;s private land, the Arab state was to have 44% of the land and a minority of 10,000 Jews. Greater Jerusalem would remain under international rule.</p>
<p>Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini declared this UN vote null and void.</p>
<p><em>108</em> The Palestinian leadership called for a general strike while the Haganah called on Jews aged between 17 to 25 to register for military service.</p>
<p>The Zionists accepted the decision, the Arabs rejected any abrogation of its sovereignty.</p>
<p><em>110</em> The Arab Higher Committee, outlawed in 1937, had been revived under the mufti in exile. In May 1946 Haj Amin al-Husseini arrived in Egypt under the protection of King Farouk amid hope of a new resistance.</p>
<p>However the Arab National Fund had not succeeded in halting land sales, calls to boycott Jewish produce had not been heeded and many supporters of Palestinian nationhood condemned the incompetent leadership.</p>
<p><em>111</em> The AHC was also divided between Jerusalem, Beirut and Damascus, undermining effective communication. Its influence was dwarfed by that of the League of Arab States, whose members, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, had their own agendas, the majority of whom were opposed to King Abdullah of Transjordan who had ambitions in Palestine.</p>
<p>The AHC had to build up Palestine&rsquo;s military capacity from scratch; nothing on their side matched the Haganah and the Arab effort was beset by rivalry; it was not until January 1947 that two existing paramilitaries the Futuwwa and the Najada were combined into a single Arab Youth Organisation.</p>
<p><em>112</em> Non-Palestinian forces were deployed by the Arab liberation Army, set up by the Arab League&rsquo;s Damascus-based military committee, it was made up of 5000 volunteers and seconded Syrian, Iraqi military personnel commanded by Fawzi al-Qawiqji. Morale was low, logistics and discipline were poor.</p>
<p>Arab States were patronising towards the Palestinians, some just went on a rampage and left, some Palestinians did not want to fight, had secret non-aggression pacts with their Jewish neighbours, opposed the Husseinis or refused to harbor foreign forces.</p>
<p><em>114</em> Palestinian civilians began to flee, in early 1947 <em>Haganah</em> reported that wealthy Arabs were moving to winter residences in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. By January 15,000 of Jaffa&rsquo;s residents had left. The AHC tried to stem these departures by radio broadcasts, urging neighbouring nations not to take Arabs but this was ineffective.</p>
<p><em>115</em> On 10 March 1948 Haganah commanders met in Tel Aviv to discuss plans to secure control of Jewish-held territory within and beyond UN partition borders. Arabs were to be expelled if they resisted, effectively ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p><em>116</em> The Haganah went on the offensive as the British departure neared and supplies of food ran low in Jewish areas of Jerusalem, capturing territory that was not earmarked under the Jewish plan.</p>
<p>Husseini, the head of the AHJ, was killed at the Arab hill-top village of Qastel.</p>
<p><em>117 - 8</em> On 9 April an Irgun-Lehi force launched an offensive on Deir Yassin, on the western edge of Jerusalem, there were reports of executions, rapes and looting, with whole families, women and children being killed, between 1 - 200 people were killed.</p>
<p>The Arab Press reported on the massacre prompted flight from nearby villages.</p>
<p>Revenge came when Arab fighters ambushed a convoy of trucks, ambulances, buses and armoured cars heading to a Jewish enclave on Jerusalem&rsquo;s Mount Scopus, 78 lecturers, students, nurses odctors and Haganah escorts were killed.</p>
<p><em>119</em> The war was won by the Zionists as Haganah units continued offensive operations helped by the arrival of rifles, machine guns and ammunition purchased from Czechslovakia.</p>
<p>Haifa and Tiberias, two cities with large Arab populations were taken.</p>
<p><em>121</em> When Haganah units entered Jaffa on 14 May only 3 - 40,00 residents remained, Zionist forces raided and looted what had been left.</p>
<p><em>122</em> The Haganah made further incursions into areas they expected neighbouring Arab states to invade, by mid-May 250,000 - 300,000 Palestinians had fled or been expelled from their homes.</p>
<p>On 15 May High Commissioner Cunningham left Haifa harbour. The previous evening the sovereign state of Israel was proclaimed as David Ben-Gurion read the declaration of independence on behalf of the Provisional Government; the state was recognised within hours by the US and the USSR.</p>
<p>Jordanian, Egyptian, Iraqi and Syrian armies invaded, with Lebanon opting out at the last minute.</p>
<p><em>123</em> Initial plans focused on invading northern Palestine with a view to reaching Haifa. King Abdullah announced Jordanian forces would head for Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron along what came to be known as the West Bank. This suggested he was seeking to avoid war with Israel by refraining from entering areas allotted to them by the UN and seemed to confirm suspicious re: collusion between the Brits, Zionist and the Hashemites which prompted the Egyptians to add a second invasion route, rather than moving forces up the coast towards Gaza and Tel Aviv, to take their forces East, an obvious attempt to outflank Abdullah.</p>
<p>Israelis encounters only Iraqi and Syrian forces in the Jordan Valley but no Egyptians, Iraqi units in Qalqilya did nothing, telling Palestinians they had no orders. Some Saudi and Yemeni troops were aso deployed.</p>
<p>Palestinian fighters were helped in Jerusalem by the arrival of Jordanian Arab Legion forces, greeted by crowds, Haganah fighters were taken prisoner after surrendering.</p>
<p><em>124</em> Israeli forces took more territory; the Alexandroni Brigade cleared more than sixty Arab villages on the plain between Tel Aviv and Haifa. The Israelis also made conquests in Galilee and in the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem &lsquo;corridor&rsquo; that the UN had allocated to the Arabs.</p>
<p><em>125</em> Nazareth was taken 16 July.</p>
<p>Operation Dani was intended to capture Arab towns of Lydda and Ramle, alloted to the Arab state, in the centre of the country and clear the last Arab-held parts of adjacent Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road. In Lydda on 12 July Israeli forces encountered a small Arab Legion force entering the town. During the ensuing firefight 250 Palestinians sheltering in a mosque compound were killed by men of the IDF&rsquo;s Yiftah Brigade; biggest atrocity of the war.</p>
<p>50,000 Palestinians were expelled on Ben-Gurion&rsquo;s orders to the Israeli commander Yitzak Rabin. Lydda residents were forced to walk for miles in summer heat in the middle of the Ramadan fast to the front lines where Arab Legion struggled to provide shelter and supplies. Unknown numbers died of exhaustion or dehydration.</p>
<p><em>126</em> A further 100,000 became refugees in the course of those ten days.</p>
<p>Under UN pressure a new open-ended truce came into effect on 18 July. Israel continued to launch operations but claimed they were not violations of this truce; Arab expulsions were ongoing. The Stern Gang assassinated the UN mediator.</p>
<p><em>128</em> Mass killing at Dawamiya.</p>
<p>Operation Hiram - New Israeli conquests in eastern Galilee, allotted to the Arab state by the UN, several villages across the border in Lebanon also occupied.</p>
<p>Atrocities in Eilabun, Safsaf and Jish led to the flight of 30,000 more Palestinians, mostly to Lebanon. Ben-Gurion instructed his units:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do all in your power for a quick and immediate cleansing of the conquered areas of all the hostile elements&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>129</em> Overall Palestinian casualities are estimated at around 13,000, 1,400 Egyptians, several hundred Iraqis and Jordanians, 4,000 Israelis.</p>
<p><strong>1949 - 53</strong></p>
<p><em>131</em> In the course of twenty months half the pre-war Arab population had fled or been driven out; 350 - 400 villages had been depopulated, many were destroyed or settled by Jewish immigrants.</p>
<p>In some areas families were divided by armistice lines which left a minority of 156,000 Palestinians in the new Jewish state, 15% of its population.</p>
<p><em>132</em> Refugees were scattered across the West Bank, occupied by Jordan, in the Egyptian-administered Gaza Strip, its original population more than doubled, in makeshift camps in Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Iraq. Majority were uneducated farmers, initially under the care of the Red Cross and then the United Nations Relief and Works Agency; many camps were shanty towns and lacked basic amenities such as running water, electricity, sewage systems.</p>
<p><em>133 - 4</em> Israel made clear early on that refugees would not be allowed to return, putting forward the narrative that they had left voluntarily, which was reproduced abroad.</p>
<p><em>135</em> Palestinian women who had fled were left so destitute they were forced into prostitution; more than 400 babies in camps around Tyre and Sidon died of cold.</p>
<p><em>136</em> Israel lifted British restrictions on immigration, in July 1950 the Law of Return granted Jews from all over the world the right to live in Israel over the native non-Jewish population. The Jewish population increased to 1.5 million in 1951, most of the newcomers arriving from Arab countries such as Iraq and Yemen where anti-Jewish sentiment had grown.</p>
<p><em>137</em> The intellectual core of Palestinian life was destroyed, as was the commercial and manufacturing bases of the Arab economy. The vast majority of those left were illiterate villagers and agricultural workers.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s national library collected 30,000 books, newspapers and other items from the abandoned homes of Palestinians who had fled West Jerusalem. Five of the eleven cities under Israeli control, Safed, Madjal, Tiberias, Beisan and Beersheba were emptied of Arabs; Jaffa, Haifa, Lydda, Ramle and Acre almost were.</p>
<p><em>138</em> The majority of Israel&rsquo;s Arabs lived in Galilee, along the Jordanian border north east of Tel Aviv and in the Negev, under military rule.</p>
<p>When the military government was established it employed two key provisions of the 1945 British Defence Emergency Regulations: the authority to declare any area closed to the public and impose a curfew.</p>
<p>Abandoned Arab land was allocated to Jews; Arab movements in and out of closed areas were regulated under a system of checkpoints, travel permits, curfews and other restrictions.</p>
<p>These permits were in Hebrew and hence illegible to those who used them and had to be approved by Shin Bet, who used them as leverage to secure informants.</p>
<p>The ministries of education, welfare, interior and religious affairs had special sections to govern the Palestinians as a separate section of the population.</p>
<p><em>146</em> Security experts opposed enfranchising Arabs, warning they would seek restitution of property and freedom of movement, but these were over-ruled.</p>
<p>In the first parliamentary elections in January 1949 3 Arab MPs entered the 120 seat Knesset. Arab lists, created by the ruling Labour party Mapai, creted a link between Arab notables who remained in the country and the structures of the state, preventing the formation of a separate political Arab bloc of opposition.</p>
<p>Divide and rule strategy adopted; 20,000 strong Druze community, Circassians (descendants of Muslim immigrants expelled from the Caucasus in the nineteenth century) and Bedouin in the south all given special treatment.</p>
<p><em>147</em> In January 1949 the IDF created a minorities unit compromising 400 Druze, 200 Bedouins and 100 Circassians commanded by Jewish officers and employed it to ambush Palestinians trying to cross armistice lines; Druze were later subject to mandatory conscription, their role was described by one Israeli officer as &lsquo;a sharp knife in the back of Arab unity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sheikhs, religious judges and other notables were granted special dispensations that strengthened traditional social structures and consolidated control of Arab areas. Collaboration brought benefits such as work and travel permits, firearm licences, a blind eye to criminality corruption and even political office.</p>
<p><strong>1953 - 58</strong></p>
<p><em>150</em> On 12 October 1953 an IDF force crossed the green line into the West Bank village of Qibya. Unit 101 was under the command of Ariel Scheinerman (later Sharon) and killed 69 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children.</p>
<p><em>151</em> This was one of 200 raids which took place in the early years of Israel&rsquo;s independence.</p>
<p>Between 1949 and 1953 fifty-seven Israelis were killed by Palestinians from the West Bank, between 1949 and 1956 between 3 - 5000 Palestinians were killed by Israel.</p>
<p><em>153</em> In November 1955, shortly after Ben-Gurion entered back into power the IDF launched a punitive raid on Gaza in response to <em>fedayeen</em> incursions.</p>
<p>The war against Egypt was launched pre-emptively by Israel in collusion with Britain and France, infuriated by Nasser&rsquo;s takeover of the Suez canal, Israel claiming they were seeking to put an end fo <em>fedayeen</em> raids from Gaza.</p>
<p><em>154</em> Israeli forces occupied the desert peninsula for four months until US pressure forced Ben-Gurion to withdraw and drop any idea of annexing Gaza, two thirds of its population now refugees living in eight large camps.</p>
<p><em>155</em> Between 930 and 1200 Palestinians died before Israel did withdraw.</p>
<p>On 29 October 1956 Israeli authorities imposed a 5pm curfew on villages near the border w/ Jordan. In Kafr Qassem border guards shot and killed 49 unarmed Arab citizens, including women and children.</p>
<p><em>156</em> Nasser very popular among Arab minority, influential in the growing Arab nationalist movement.</p>
<p><em>159</em> In Israel the Nakba was not taught in schools or mentioned in print due to military censorship. The use of the word &lsquo;watan&rsquo; for &lsquo;homeland&rsquo; was also banned. A teacher was sacked for writing poetry about a mulberry tree in his old village of al-Mujaydil, renamed Migdal HaEmek in Hebrew.</p>
<p><em>160</em> The government produced a daily newspaper in Arabic reporting mainly on visits from government officials, the building of roads and other &lsquo;positive&rsquo; stories; it focused on the village and clan structures of Arab life, emphasising backwardness and orientalist stereotypes of underdevelopment, even when most Arabs lived in towns; it was widely mocked.</p>
<p><em>161</em> Fears were expressed for national security over the fact that knowledge of Arabic among Jews was declining; Arab writers usually learned Hebrew but things didn&rsquo;t flow the other way; parents preferred their kids to learn English and French rather than a &lsquo;backwards&rsquo; language like Arabic.</p>
<p>School tours were arranged by IDF intelligence to Druze villages and Nazareth with guides provided by intelligence officials but not the natives. Students of these Orientalist courses were expected to practice colloquial Arabic and learn about Arab customs but never speak to the native population about politics. These courses were followed by jobs in IDF intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>1958 - 67</strong></p>
<p><em>162</em> Israelis celebrated the tenth anniversary of their independence in April 1958 with a military parade in West Jerusalem.</p>
<p><em>164</em> The majority of citizens supported the state&rsquo;s policies in not taking back Arab refugees; that they had been responsible for the 1948 war and left voluntarily. A state inquiry heard testimony to this effect and emphasised the threat the Arabs represented to the state.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;Palestinian&rsquo; was not used in Hebrew or English discourse in the 1950s except on the far left.</p>
<p><em>165</em> Of nearly a million refugees more than half were under 15.</p>
<p><em>166</em> Dissatisfaction broke out at continuing restrictions on movement which still applied to 85% of Israeli Arabs. Communist organisers were arrested and a May Day rally banned. When this was ignored, with slogans such as &lsquo;End military rule&rsquo; and &lsquo;Long live Nasser&rsquo;, 300 were arrested.</p>
<p><em>167</em> A small group of Arab intellectuals founded The Land in the spirit of Nasserism and the Arab nationalist movement, calling for a repeal of all discriminatory laws and the right to return; this represented a parting of the ways between Arab nationalists and communist organisations.</p>
<p>Its call to boycott the 1959 Knesset elections led to weakened Arab representation and worried the security establishment.</p>
<p><em>168</em> In February 1958 Egypt and Syria announced the creation of the United Arab Republic. In May civil war broke out in in Lebanon, the July the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown, the US and Britain feared a Nasserist coup in Jordan; the Algerian rebellion was ongoing, a source of inspiration for Palestinians.</p>
<p>Jordan treated Palestinians better than any other Arab country, granting them citizenship rather than refugee status, but de-legitimated Palestinian nationality as it was thought this represented a challenge to Arab unity; use of the term Palestine in official documentation or correspondence was banned. Associations with a Palestinian character such as the Haifa cultural association in Balus, the Jaffa Muslim Sports Club in Ramallah were not allowed to engage in political activity.</p>
<p><em>169</em> Lebanon introduced the most severe restrictions on the 100 - 130,000 Palestinians who had arrived in 1949. Prejudice and mistreatment was common.</p>
<p>The majority of the 300,000 Palestinians in Egypt lived under military administration and emergency laws in the Gaza strip that lasted until 1962.</p>
<p><em>170</em> George Habash, a refugee from Lydda founded the ANM while he was a medical student in an American university in Beirut; the organisation was directed towards the union of all Arab states.</p>
<p>Yasser Arafat, born in Egypt in 1929 to a Gazan father and mother had lived in Jerusalem briefly, studied in Cairo university and fought in the 1948 war as part of a Muslim Brotherhood unit, complaining that he was disarmed twice, first by the Egyptian army and next while serving with Abdul-Qader al-Husseini by the Jordanian Arab legion.</p>
<p>Arafat failed to get a visa to Saudi Arabia and ended up in Kuwait as an engineer with the ministry of public works.</p>
<p><em>171</em> He founded the Palestinian Liberation Movement (or Fatah) with Salah Khalaf, a literature student born in Ramala and expelled to Gaza as a teenager.</p>
<p>Fatah received funding from wealthy families in the gulf including Kuwaiti and Qatari ruling families.</p>
<p><em>173</em> It sought to liberated the whole of Palestine and end the Zionist occupation, with an emphasis on armed struggle, influenced by Fanon, the black civil rights movement in the US and the Mau Mau, but they found it difficult to compete against Nasserism, by 1963 the organisation still had only a few hundred members.</p>
<p>The break-up of the Egypt-Syria union in September 1961 and the civil war in Yemen with Saudis and Nasser backing opposing sides were blows to Arab unity and the success of the FLN in 1962 gave credibility to anti-colonial armed struggle.</p>
<p>Syria agreed to host Fatah and young men from refugee camps were sent there for military training; Iraq also provided facilities and Algeria became a supporter. IDF intelligence didn&rsquo;t regard them as a threat so much as a nuisance.</p>
<p><em>174</em> Israeli plans to divert water from the River Jordan via its national water canal to the Negev desert had led to armed clashes on the Syrian border; Israel&rsquo;s plan to acquire nuclear weapons was also a concern.</p>
<p>In January 1964 Nasser convened a summit of Arab kings and presidents in Cairo declaring the collective goal of the Arab states was the liquidation of Israel and spoke of organising the Palestinians to liberate its country.</p>
<p>The fear was that leaving the cause to the other Arab regimes would lead to the catastrophe of 1948, Haj Amin al-Hussein, leading the old Arab Higher Committee from exile in Beirut was a vocal critic, Arafat too was wary and sent a representative rather than attending himself.</p>
<p><em>175</em> King Hussein was a reluctant host; Jordanian intelligence maintained an intrusive and intimidating presence.</p>
<p>The meeting announced the formation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which reconstituted itself as the Palestine National Council, the PLO&rsquo;s &lsquo;parliament&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The new organisation&rsquo;s charter called for the total liberation of Palestine and self-determination within the borders of the British mandate. It rejected the Balfour declaration, the Mandate system and claims of historical ties between Jews and Palestine, arguing Judaism was a religion and not a nationality.</p>
<p>Arafat kept his distance from this new body, discretely seeking help and training facilities from Syria, Algeria and Jordan.</p>
<p><em>176</em> In 1964 Fatah&rsquo;s first military engagement against Israel was intercepted by Lebanese forces. Three days later it planted an explosive charge in the national water carrier canal in the Bet Netofa valley in lower Galilee. It did not go off but the raid was regarded as a propaganda success.</p>
<p>Their activities unsettled Nasser as potentially marking the trigger point for a military action at the wrong time which would be beyond their control, even as they hailed their successes.</p>
<p><em>177</em> Part of Fatah&rsquo;s strategy was to provoke a reaction which would prompt the intervention of the other Arab states.</p>
<p>Tensions rose as Fatah&rsquo;s attacks continued, Jordan being the most hostile, arresting 200 subversives including most of the PLO staff in Amman. In July Jordanian forces clashed with a Palestinian commando squad on its way to Israel, killing four of them.</p>
<p>In October after a bombing in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Romema district Jordan accepted lists of <em>fedayeen</em> collaborators and arrested them but was also attacked by Israel in November in a punitive attack on Samu, south of Hebron on the West Bank.</p>
<p><em>178</em> This assault left 18 dead, 130 injured, 120 houses destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>1967</strong></p>
<p><em>180</em> Israel&rsquo;s pre-emptive military operation was planned for the end of Egyptian dawn patrols and began with a ground offensive into Gaza and the Sinai, reaching the Suez Canal and Sharm el-Sheikh at the peninsula&rsquo;s southern tip.</p>
<p>Nasser induced Syria and Jordan to launch attacks. Israel had urged King Hussein to stay out of the war retaliated with an offensive to encircle East Jerusalem. Israeli forces initially held back from entering the Old City over religious sensitivities but on 7 June newly appointed minister for defense Moshe Dayan gave the order to attack; Israel conquered the city later that day.</p>
<p>Israeli forces captured Nablus without a shot being fired; IDF units were mistaken for Iraqi reinforcements, Bethlehem fell. When King Hussein ordered his forces to pull back across the Jordan, Israel occupied the rest of the West Bank unopposed. Israel&rsquo;s retaliation against Syria took the form of an air strike which destroyed two-thirds of the Syrian air force, giving them total air superiority.</p>
<p>On 11 June a ceasefire was agreed; Arab losses were over 20,000.</p>
<p>Israel had more than tripled its size and shortened its borders from 983 to 601 km, ruling over 1.1 million Palestinians.</p>
<p>On 27 June the government voted to unite western and eastern parts of Jerusalem, more than doubling municipal jurisdiction to include the newer Arab suburbs and twelve villages, incorporating 69,000 Palestinians and extending to Ramallah in the north and Bethlehem in the south.</p>
<p><em>187</em> Military rule was imposed in these newly annexed areas, banking activities were suspended, financial restrictions, curfews, detention without trial, expulsion and house demolitions under powers put in place by the Brits. Three Palestinian villages, Imwas, Yalu and Beit Nuba were destroyed a week after their inhabitants, expelled to Ramallah, tried to return.</p>
<p><em>189</em> Estimates suggest 200,000 Palestinians displaced; many of these were refugees for a second time, Israel providing transport for them to move east, forcing them to sign documents to the effect that they were doing so willingly.</p>
<p><em>190</em> Gaza&rsquo;s population was densely distributed, mostly urban and young, 65% of them refugees from 1948. Less developed and more isolated than the West Bank, more dependent on Israelis for services and general assistance, weaker institutions.</p>
<p><em>192</em> More difficult for Fatah to operate with blowback potentially attending to the Arab states they worked within; claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded outside the old Fast hotel inside West Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Guerrilla bands of between 10 - 15 operated in the Nablus-Jenin-Tulkarem area and Hebron hills commanded by men who had trained in China and Algeria but the IDF and border police inflicted heavy losses through killings and arrests.</p>
<p><em>193</em> Jordan co-operated with Israel in the running of the West Bank.</p>
<p><em>194</em> Israeli officials liked to present their occupation as enlightened but no resistance was tolerated; curfews, arrests and searches were deployed in response to a school strike over the withdrawal of Arab textbooks; &lsquo;dissidents&rsquo; were often deported.</p>
<p><em>202</em> Debates within Israeli government as to the future of occupation; permanent annexation, granting a new state, settling the area or giving it back to Jordan while retaining control of security.</p>
<p>Ultimately this decision, and discussion with Jordan, was deferred.</p>
<p><strong>1968 - 72</strong></p>
<p><em>207</em> 3,345 dunams of private land in East Jerusalem were cleared for a new Jewish suburb; the first settlement built in occupied territory after the war.</p>
<p><em>208</em> These settlements were slow to expand beyond East Jerusalem, partly for political reasons; Israel argued the West Bank did not constitute occupied territory since Mandatory Palestine had been divided in 1949 and Jordan&rsquo;s unilateral annexation of the West Bank had only been recognised by the Brits and Afghanistan, justified on the basis of the right to return.</p>
<p><em>212</em> In March 1968 Israel launched an attack on Fatah backed by the Jordanian army; despite an ostensible Israeli victory it was a propaganda win for the PLO; the Israelis left a tank and a number of trucks which Arafat and King Hussein photographed themselves with.</p>
<p><em>213</em> Four months later the Palestine National Council allotted seats to the <em>fedayeen</em> groups for the first time.</p>
<p>The PLO&rsquo;s national covenant underwent significant changes in July 1968, emphasising the nationhood of the Palestinians and highlighting armed struggle as the only way to liberation. It also clarified that only Jews who had been living in Palestine before the Zionist invasion could be considered Palestinian; Fatah called for equal right regardless of religion.</p>
<p>In February 1969 Arafat became chairman of the PLO executive committee.</p>
<p><em>215</em> Support for the <em>fedayeen</em> grew in the West Bank as support for Jordanian loyalists fell; the new universities founded in the area created a new politically conscious generation.</p>
<p><em>216</em> In 1971 the <em>fedayeen</em> struggle reached its peak in the Gaza Strip, numbers were swelled by fighters fleeing escalating attacks on the PLO in Jordan; killings of Palestinians regarded as collaborators were common. Weapons stockpiled during Egyptian rule were gathered, others were smuggled in from Sinai, orange groves provided natural cover for guerrillas.</p>
<p>Sharon led a brutal counter-insurgency campaign, imposing 24 hour curfews and a shoot-to-kill policy. Roads were cleared through Gaza&rsquo;s biggest refugee camps, about 100,000 people had been forced to find new homes by mid 1971.</p>
<p><em>218</em> This repression forced Palestinian resistance abroad.</p>
<p>King Hussein became worried about the future of his regime with PLO presence increasing and Fatah mounting 200 operations a month from Jordan, clamped down on the Palestinians but then agreed an armistice with Arafat.</p>
<p>In September 1970 the PFLP hijacked three civilian airliners and blew them up in the kingdom and Hussein declared martial law, PLO forces were routed and driven out of the country, between 3 - 5000 Palestinians and 600 Jordanians were forced out fo the country.</p>
<p>In October 1970 King Hussein met the Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Yigal Allon promising to prevent further <em>fedayeen</em> raids. 3 - 5,000 Palestinian fighters fled to Lebanon, another 2,300 were taken prisoner. 72 surrendered to the Israelis rather than fight the Jordanians.</p>
<p><strong>1973 - 77</strong></p>
<p><em>226</em> On 6 October 1973 Egyptian and Syrian offensives along the Suez Canal and Golan Heights triggered air strikes, artillery duels and tank battles. Israel was caught unprepared by the breaching of its Bar-Lev line east of the canal and initial Egyptian advances in Sinai.</p>
<p>Mobilisation of IDF reserves turned the tide; when a UN-brokered ceasefire was introduced on 14 October Israeli forces were fifty miles from Cairo and twenty-five from Damascus; the entire Egpytian Third Army were encircled by the IDF on the Eastern bank of the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>A general strike took place in the occupied territories, Palestinian Liberation Army troops were deployed in a limited capacity on both fronts but the majority of Palestinians played no role, nor did Jordan.</p>
<p><em>227</em> Israel suffered 2,650 losses, their largest since 1948, Egypt and Syria together lost 16,000.</p>
<p>The war had been launched by Sadat and Hafez al-Assad with the limited goal of challenging the post-67 settlement. The Egyptian president hoped to impose a peace settlement, Assad was anxious to liberate the Golan Heights and was slightly more committed to the cause. Egypt regained territory, Syria did not.
At the Algiers Arab summit conference in November 1973 all twenty-one Arab states recognised the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>In the UN two weeks later Arafat offered &rsquo;the gun or the olive branch&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>234</em> In May 1977 Menachem Begin&rsquo;s Likud, an alliance of the right wing Herut party and the liberals emerged as the largest party in the general election after a campaign focused on allegations of incompetence surrouding Yitzhak Rabin&rsquo;s government after the Yom Kippur war.</p>
<p>Begin was remembered as the leader of the Irgun, perpetrator of the bombing of the King David Hotel and the Deir Yassin massacre; his election indicated the increasingly rightist direction of travel, settlements would be expanded under him.</p>
<p><em>238</em> This expansion of settlements meant more confiscation of Palestinian land, more water under Israeli control, the extension of Israeli law.</p>
<p><em>239</em> The number of settlers in the West Bank rose to 12,500 by 1980, with a view to Balkanising it out of existence. New settlements were built by Palestinians, making them an indispensible part of the labour force, even while social intercourse propert was limited.</p>
<p><strong>1977 - 81</strong></p>
<p><em>241</em> In November 1977 Sadat flew from Cairo to Tel Aviv and signed a peace treaty with the Israelis, on the principle of returning land to Egypt of all territory it had lost to Israel in 67 except the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p><em>242</em> This was a crushing blow to the PLO.</p>
<p><em>243</em> Arafat condemned Sadat but did not join a radical Arab bloc of Stria, Algeria, South Yemen and Libya which cut all ties with Egypt.</p>
<p><em>244</em> On 25 December 1977 Begin visited Ismailiya on the Suez Canal, Cairo being deemed too hostile an environment. Carter called on Begin to recognise the rights of Palestinians and the prospects of talks receded.</p>
<p>Shortly after a squad of thirteen Fatah men landed on a deserted beach in Haifa and killed thirty-eight Israeli civilians.</p>
<p><em>245</em> Three days later Israel sent 25,000 troops into Lebanon to push Palestinian fighters away from the border and bolster their local proxy the South Lebanon Army (SLA). Seven days of fighting ended with a ceasefire, with 1,100 people killed, mostly Palestinian and Lebanese. Between 100,000 and 250,000 people were displaced.</p>
<p>Sadat and Begin visited Washington in summer 1978 but relations worsened. In September Carter brought the two to Camp David in Maryland.</p>
<p><em>246</em> After two weeks agreement on removal of military bases from the Sinai was reached and normalisation of relations would occur, Sadat would receive $1.3 billion of annual US aid to the Egyptian armed forces.</p>
<p>A Second Camp David document agreed future negotiations would be based on UN Resolution 242 but the PLO was not entioned.</p>
<p><em>247</em> Palestinian opposition hardened, Jordan declined to join talks on a self-governing authority, West Bank mayors were dismissive that autonomy would mean a change from the status quo.</p>
<p>A National Guidance Committee was formed in November 1978 representing and co-ordinating Palestinian trade unions and student body resistance. Fatah was part of this 23 member body but did not dominate it.</p>
<p>Following the signing of the Egyptian accord the biggest protest strike in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 took place.</p>
<p><em>251</em> Begin&rsquo;s second term as prime minister began in August 1981; changes to occupation policy included a separate civilian administration in the West Bank and Gaza, which would be subordinate to the military government. Division of labour was designed to pre-empt the outcome of autonomy talks with Egypt by implementing Israel&rsquo;s interpretation of Camp David unilaterally.</p>
<p><em>252</em> The head of the new administration Menachem Milson was a professor who bolstered the Israeli-backed Village Leagues which had been established to counter the influence of the PLO in the cities, on the basis that the conservative rural sector, 70% of the West Bank&rsquo;s population, would be easier to influence.</p>
<p>Palestinians were hostile but Jordan&rsquo;s decision to ban membership of the Leagues on pain of death and confiscation of property was decisive.</p>
<p><strong>1982 - 87</strong></p>
<p><em>260</em> In September 1982 Reagan unveiled a plan for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, creating an entity that would be linked to Jordan.</p>
<p>It also called for a freeze on settlements and Palestinian responsibility for internal security.</p>
<p><em>268</em> In February 1986 Hussein broke with Arafat and the Israelis allowed Palestinians to take over from IDF officers who had been running West Bank town halls since mayors had been sacked in 1982. The scion of a prominent local family took the job but was assassinated.</p>
