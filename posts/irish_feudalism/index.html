<p><em>2</em> Armagh had a position of prominence by hte seventh century because of its being supposedly founded by st. Patrick.</p>
<p><em>3</em> This is why brian Bóraime promoted the primatial claims of a Munster church, aligned himself with Armagh; requirements to acquire a national ecclesiastical capital.</p>
<p><em>4</em> A body of law tracts called the Brehon laws surviving from the 7th - 9th centuries give us the insights were have into medieval Irish society.
These make clear that in early Ireland individuals did not own land in their own right but as part of a kin-group.</p>
<p>The group that inherited the land was not the modern family, but a four-generation group, the derbfhine (&lsquo;central kindred&rsquo;) comprising male descendents in the male line, of a common great-grandfather.</p>
<p>Women could inherit movable goods and a life interest in the family if their father had no sons.</p>
<p>The derbfhine held land jointly, makred off from that of hte neighbouring kin-group by fences and boundary stones, each member having an equal share of he family lnad. Wiht the passage of each generation the land was repartitioned between survving members so eah had an equal portion of good and bad land, arable, pasture or bog etc.</p>
<p>As time moved on inheritance came to be confined to a closer male-descent group, the gelfhine &lsquo;bright kindred&rsquo;, comprising a man, his sons and his son&rsquo;s sons; there&rsquo;s limited evidence for large numbers of people owning land comunally.</p>
<p><em>5</em> Early medieval Ireland was a hierarchy of aristocrats, their dependents and their slaves. Slavery was common, a person could be born into slavery or condemned to such a life as punishment for crime or as a consequence of war.</p>
<p>Slaves owned no land and the demands put on them were onerous and arbitrary. The middle class, the commoner or non-lordly class comprised those who owned or aspired to own land. There were eight different ranks of commoner, but it is not always clear that these are not just a legalistic insistence on rigid distinctions over a more fluid reality.</p>
<p>The disparity between grades can be seen by the differing &lsquo;honour prices&rsquo; or comepnsation payable for a legal fofence againt them, which was considered an offense to their honour.</p>
<p>Thus a man of cultivated land had an honour price of three milch cows, a cow-freeman would be owed two-and-ahalf, that of a between-house man, yet to acquire their own land was a two yearo-old heifer.</p>
<p>there was a clear distinction between a commonr and a flaith, someone of a noble rank but the barriers were porous to a certain extent, upward and downward mobility was possible over a number of generations.</p>
<p><em>6</em> Feudalism is a system in which the lords held all the land and granted portions of it as fiefs to their vassals in return for rent or military aid or helpw itht eh arvest.</p>
<p>In the Irish system the céle (client) had his own land by inheritance; what the lord gave him was cattle or other livestock and a rpomise of protection. In return the lord could expect a portion of profits in th form of meat or butter or cheese and liited farm duties in the lord&rsquo;s reaping-party or entertainment.</p>
<p>There were different ranks of lord, seven grades of churchmen and seven grades of poet.</p>
<p><em>7</em> The basic unit of political organisation was the túath. While many within the túath were related, there would often have been many who were not related to the túath by blood, in that sense it was not strictly tribal, despite the system of naming túath and other territoies fter an ancester figure.</p>
<p>Brian Bóraime&rsquo;s dynastyy was called Dál Cais because it claimed to be the dál of a supposed ancestor called Cass. But this was the naem of both teh lineage and the territorial kingdom from which the lineage ruled, not everyone in that territory belonged to the lineage.</p>
<p><em>8</em> Ireland was dominated by political groupings calling themselves the uí of or the cenél of or the corcu or the dál of.</p>
<p><em>11</em> The language used in these laws is uniform and grammatically standardised; it was written by professional jurists and members of the áes dána whose authority transcended local boundaries; they practiced their occupation across the Irish world.</p>
<p>What comes across in these documents is the degree to which the Irish regarded themselves as a single unified people, a national origin myth present in Lebor Gabála Érenn (&lsquo;The book of the taking of Ireland&rsquo;) which recounters succesive waves of invaders from the time of Cessair to Noah&rsquo;s son Bith to Partholón who fought the Formorian demons to Nemed the Scythian to the Fir Bolg (who may be related to the Continental Celtic tribe Belgae) to the magical Túathe Dé Danann (the people&rsquo;sof the Goddess Danu&rsquo;) the climax coming with the Milesians.</p>
<p>These are the Iish and the invasion myth had them descend from the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, her name Scota giving the Latin name of ht island, while her son Goídeal Glas gives his name to the people (the Goídil) and their language (Goídelc), seems to have been derived from the name given to them by hte welsh, Gwyddyl.</p>
<p><em>12</em> They claimed Goídeal Glas (or his ancestor Fénius Farsaid) derived the language from all the best bits scattered acros the world from the Tower of Babel. It is noteworthy how developed the Irish vernacular literaure was.</p>
<p>This fixation on genealogy derived from the Bible gave a powerful sense of dynastic solidarity.</p>
<p><em>13</em> The Hilll of Tara is 2km in length but never more than 150m high, preserves monuments from the late Stone Age. Extensive remains from the Bronze and Iron age but little archaeological evidence for occupation or use during the middle ages. Features prominently in Irish mythology as a place connected with the the gods of ancient Ireland; when the sons of Míl, the ancestors of the Irish first arrived in Ireland they confrontated hte Túatha Dé Danann at Tara and defeated them at nearly Tailtiu, this made clear thir current claims on tara and on Ireland in general.</p>
<p>On the Hill of Tara there is a stone called the Lia Fáil which cries out beneath the feet of hte rightful king of Ireland; the individual concerend did not necessariyl ever manage to cnotrol each kingdom but he special status was recognised.</p>
<p><em>15</em> The kingship of Tara was monopolised by the Uí Néill, one great dynasty with many sprawling branches, and tara came to be associated with their attempts to claim hegemony across the island.</p>
<p>Muirchú, who wrote a life of St. Patrick around the year 700 describes the celebrated historical or pseudo-historical figure Niall Noígiallach (&ldquo;NIall of the Nine Hostages&rdquo;) as one who descended from teh royal stock of the entire island, which is an exagerration but indicative also of how many dominant lineages traced themselves bck to Niall.</p>
<p>Assuming he was real he may have lived in the fifth century and descended frmo Conn Céthathach (&ldquo;Conn of the Hundred battles&rdquo;) who is believed to have lived seven generations before Niall, in the late iron Age.</p>
<p><em>16</em> This dynasty was divided in the southern Uí Néill of the mislands and the Northern Uí Néill, both of which are terms of convenience for competing brnaches.</p>
<p><em>42</em> Wars were fought for political abmition whihch the Uí Néil claimed based on their status as kings of Tara.</p>
<p><em>44</em> Irish churchmen were active on the continent from the seventh century, beginning with Columbanus. They were missonaries but also teachers, grammarians, classicists and philosophers.</p>
<p>Dícúil writes about hermits in the Faroe Islands being harrassed by Bikings; indicative of the negative experience of churchmen in north-west Europe when faced with raiding.</p>
<p><em>45</em> Writings also describe their settling areas they raided, setting up sheep pastures.</p>
<p><em>46</em> certain Scandinavian rulers acquired wealth from trade in slaves and luxury commodities such as walrus-ivory.</p>
<p>The first recorded raid took place in 793 when the monastery founded by Irish monks on Holy Island at Lindisfarne in Northumbria was attacked.</p>
<p>Riads on Ireland began in 795 as either Rathlin or Lambay Island was burned by the Vikings, its shrines broken and plundered.</p>
<p><em>48</em> Suggestions that a more sophisticated relationships developed tan just raiding [collapse this was material from teh above]</p>
<p><em>50</em> Patterns of warfare don&rsquo;t suggest mere raiding activity but a more serious territorial wars against an established force.</p>
<p><em>52</em> In the 830s Ireland was expoed to intensive Scandinavian assault, like England and the western territories in the Carolingian Empire, beginning at Leinster and Southern Uí Néil territory in Brega, with fleets operating in the Boyne, the Liffey, the Shannon, the Erne and Lough Neagh. In 841 they built a ship-camp in Dublin and another at Linn Duachaill followed by one on Lough Ree</p>
<p>Their being located permanently in Ireland saw them take sides in Irish wars and becoming vulnerable to Irish resistance; the late 840s saw a string of Irish victories; the King of Osraige Cerball mac Dúnlainge made a name for himself as an opponent of Viking activity in the Barrow Valley, killing 1,200 Vikings. The following year Máel Sechnaill killed 700 in a battle at Skreen, the combined forces of Munster and Leinster killed 200 or 1,200 near Castleddermot.</p>
<p>The Frankish Annals of St-Bertin record the following year a delegation arrived at the court of Charlemagne&rsquo;s grandson Chalres the Bald bearing gifts from presumably Máel Sechnaill, announcing the vanquishing of the heathens by the Irish.</p>
<p><em>53</em> Unclear whether Irish military tactics adapted, viking disunity provoked some to join the Irish side, Iceland presented a more appealing prospect for unsettled land.</p>
<p><em>55</em> In any case, Uí Néill&rsquo;s success in repelling an invasion; significant achievement.</p>
