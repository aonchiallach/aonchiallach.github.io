Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories.

<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(A cursory analysis of theories of revolution pre and post Marx. I was asked to write this for a general audience publication but it was spiked for eclecticism.)</em></p>
<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>

Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on.

<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories.

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(A cursory analysis of theories of revolution pre and post Marx. I was asked to write this for a general audience publication but it was spiked for eclecticism.)</em></p>
<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>

The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(A cursory analysis of theories of revolution pre and post Marx. I was asked to write this for a general audience publication but it was spiked for eclecticism.)</em></p>
<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class.

One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises.

The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(A cursory analysis of theories of revolution pre and post Marx. I was asked to write this for a general audience publication but it was spiked for eclecticism.)</em></p>
<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire.

Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(A cursory analysis of theories of revolution pre and post Marx. I was asked to write this for a general audience publication but it was spiked for eclecticism.)</em></p>
<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>

In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>
<p>The strength of the writings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, arise from their attention to real-world instances, events and examples from the context in which they wrote and acted. One of the primary issues with formulating revolutionary theory within our own situation, is that we lack these examples. The most recent point at which movements for national and social liberation were widespread was more than half a century ago and emerge from very specific legacies of colonialism, which of course remain with us, but in less overt forms, which are far more adept at nullifying or re-directing dissent. It is obvious that capitalism faces a multitude of conflicting crises. Profitability is at such a low point that the only strategy the major capitalist powers have for growth is the financialisation and inflation of assets, for the purposes of which mechanisms such as zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing have been devised, leading to a situation in which inflation may have escaped the capacity of global financial institutions to control. The system which has brought the majority of the world’s population into unfathomable depths of poverty now offloading onto them the consequences of climate change all seem to point towards a certain terminus. However, environmental concerns aside, this portentous analysis echoes in many respects that of many within the second international and we should not understate the capacity and creativity of capitalism to re-direct itself to evade crises, especially given that the left has a long journey ahead in bringing itself to the strength or organisational capacity it had a century ago.</p>

			<description>(A cursory analysis of theories of revolution pre and post Marx. I was asked to write this for a general audience publication but it was spiked for eclecticism.)
Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(A cursory analysis of theories of revolution pre and post Marx. I was asked to write this for a general audience publication but it was spiked for eclecticism.)</em></p>
<p>Readers of Marx will know that his writings, on the levels of their content, topic and style, can be separated into two distinct categories. First, the polemical journalism marshalling a broad swathe of human history and social change within highly quotable, almost literary turns of phrase, second, the more abstract, scientific (possibly less enjoyable but no less necessary) critiques of political economy.</p>
<p>This is of course not to suggest that Marx’s writings on current affairs are devoid of serious analysis, nor that works such as Capital are free from spleen. Rather I wish to argue that these two reasonably distinct writing styles are products of the two revolutions which shaped the continent Marx surveyed and resultantly, the social phenomena he subsumed within enormously powerful conceptual frameworks which still provide us with crucial insights into the nature of change in human society. We might go so far as to suggest that it is in the dual character of revolution itself that these two formal impulses find their source; the romanticism of the French bourgeoisie coming from below, the merciless administrative revolution of English industry imposing itself from above. We will begin in reverse chronological order, with the latter of these two.</p>
<p>A simplistic account of the Industrial Revolution would confine its geography to England, Scotland, Wales and its temporal span to the nineteenth century, though its predicates and consequences extend far further than western Europe, to cotton plantations in the southern United States, Ireland, as well as other colonial peripheries from which raw materials, food and labour were plundered to fuel this domestic transformation of social relations; a growing population, urbanisation, pasture, infrastructure, railways, canals, factories, steel and coal. Out of these raw materials a new, stronger, modern form of social domination came, one far more sustainable than the one based on landed property and hereditary titles that preceded it.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself of course pre-dates industrial formation. Evidence for the existence of capitalist enterprise and wage labour within feudal as well as pre-feudal societies have been documented most comprehensively from a Marxist perspective by Jairus Banaji in Theory as History (2010). Fundamentally Marx’s writings pertain to a European model of capitalism, as we would expect given where he came from as well as the nature of the historical evidence which was then available to him. Marx’s understanding of conditions through which peoples outside of Europe reproduced their existence was overwhelmingly derived from the highly distorted works of European Orientalists. Later in life Marx ultimately dismissed Orientalism, but sadly never took the information he had derived from more accurate sources into a full-length work, which might have broadened the scope through which we understand the rise of capitalism both within and without Europe’s boundaries. Nevertheless, quantity has a quality of its own and the extent of there-shaping to which the natural environment was subject, the partial democratisation of social life brought about a definitively novel synthesis of mercantile, industrial and financial capital, which, like these earlier instances, still ebbed and flowed or remained vulnerable to internal and exogenous shocks, but has survived, unbroken, to the present day.</p>
<p>Industry in late eighteenth-century France was not sufficiently developed in and of itself to bring about a revolution on the scale of the English one. The motor which drove the events of 1789 was oiled by the deep intellectual ferment among thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and Voltaire. A middle class of educated entrepreneurs, lawyers, local administrators, teachers, who were beginning to engage with the writings of these authors, to interrogate the control the Church exerted over social and moral life, found that the lack of consistent representative or consultative assemblies, the limitations of state mechanisms such as taxation, diplomacy and warfare when under the control of inefficient, expensive and apathetic monarchs with the power to wage expensive dynastic wars undermined their business interests. The revolution might have simply eked out a few reforms addressing these issues were this the only strata roused to action by, but these radical ideas which challenged superstition, prejudice and tradition as expressed in monarchical and aristocratic authority also spread among a far more destitute section of the population, among tradesmen, workers and agricultural labourers, who derived from them a utopian vision of a society rationalised and governed according to the precepts of human reason.</p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto (1848) Marx articulates this as a struggle between two competing ways in which society may be organised; a gestating cold, rational and calculating capitalism, the aspiration of the propertied to strengthen their hand borne along in part by the energies of the dispossessed, against an unenlightened, backwards, decaying and romantic feudalism. In this latter mode of production commodities are produced by urban artisans in workshops they own and live in. This is a specialised handicraft, it is learned on a controlled basis, there are barriers to entry, each master would have a certain number of apprentices and they are often members of representative associations called guilds. Industrial production and the coercive laws of the capitalist market administers a fatal shock to this system, forcing people out of small production in rural homesteads, or living off agricultural surplus, into factories to earn their wages by selling their labour power to a capitalist entrepreneur.</p>
<p>For a certain amount of the working day this wage is being earned but once the worker has manufactured sheets of linen which they could theoretically buy back with their wages, but any further value generated is recouped by the capitalist without paying for it in the form of surplus. It is precisely because of this surplus that Marx is interested in the working class in the first place. This class as a whole confronts this method of surplus extraction as a mechanism through which they can be further exploited on a larger scale. The capitalist subsists as a parasite on the work of others and there is therefore no reason why he cannot be eliminated from the equation. The worker might instead be producing sufficient linen to satisfy the requirements of society at large, to clothe as many people as might need it rather than wasteful consumption in the form of say, decorative curtains, and thereafter, enjoy their day. Having achieved or at least having in view its bourgeois revolution, Europe now needed a proletarian revolution, to usher in a social order of authentic freedom, finally overthrowing private property, the vice both feudalism and capitalism held in common.</p>
<p>This was the central difference between Marx’s conception of socialism and those of other socialists or social reformers of the time. Marx’s attention is focused on the material reality of capitalism, predicting its direction of travel on the basis of its internal contradictions or tension points, understanding how the class character of society creates objective barriers and how these barriers might be overcome. Utopian socialists or anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Wilhelm Weitling made more vague appeals to a universal brotherhood of humanity and called for popular uprisings of labourers to the end of an effective return to social relations under feudalism, in which the individual craftsman might roll back the deleterious consequences of industrialisation. Marx knew that it is only through industrialisation that a future of material abundance could be achieved and appeals for a return to a pre-industrial past is not just reactionary but ultimately impossible. The competitive pressures of the market from which industrial capitalism emerges cannot be wished away, but must be transcended. In this way a bourgeois revolution was a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of socialism. This is not to suggest that these events are in any respect schematic or pre-determined. The process by which people were alienated fromtheir smallholdings, the means by which they obtained their material sustenance, was a brutal process. Capitalism comes into existence as Marx wrote, ‘dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt’. Any transfer of class power is likely to be similarly disruptive and therefore socialism is to be achieved through struggle, organising, forming organisations such as unions, social democratic parties and international organisations in which the socialist parties of each nation can meet and discuss and co-ordinate the formation of a front against the bourgeoisie. In certain respects this trajectory simplifies the events themselves, which threatens to omit differing tendencies and competing factions whose particular interests did not always tend in this single direction. However, like Marx’s abstract model of capitalism in which distinct modes of production emerge from and supersede others, it allows us to understand what is taking place behind the epiphenomena, the logic behind the events, if they can be said to have any and nuance any major distortions in a particular context with actual historical evidence.</p>
<p>For a labour movement coming into existence alongside a system of exploitation operating for the first time on a global scale, the French Revolution was the intuitive model for the construction of a new society based on social justice, not just due to the challenge it offered to arbitrary forms of authority which workers now found themselves subject to, but also the utopian promise of transforming social relations between people, an actualisation of how society might fulfil basis liberal demands for equality and freedom on a mass basis. This was to be the ideological inheritance of the Jacobins, one of the more radical factions of the revolution, led by Maximilien de Robespierre who set the pace of the revolution from the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793 until Robespierre’s fall from favour in 1794. Amidst the paranoia, and significant number of often arbitrary executions which characterised the Jacobins’ reign, there was a germ or ethic of social equality and welfare, as well asthe expansion of the franchise to all citizens, including women. At the outset of his political career Napoleon Bonaparte was an ally of the Jacobin faction and his own regime was contradictory. In order to secure popular support he retained many aspects of the revolution’s achievements. He did not seek to render the state more hospitable for the French aristocracy who were in exile, he constructed a modern bureaucracy, granted freedom to the Jews, militarily assisted the United Irishmen, but crowned himself Emperor and moved against the anti-colonial rebellion which preceded our own in Haiti.</p>
<p>The moment of revolutionary outpouring in Europe that emerged the same year The Communist Manifesto was published, and in which Engels briefly participated, ultimately came to nothing. The first instance which provided Marx with a concrete example against which theories of proletarian revolution might be tested came with the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>The Commune anticipated many of the revolutions which were to take place during the following century, in that it occurred due to French state’s participation in a disastrous war effort brought about by an incompetent monarch, whose legitimacy Marx had diagnosed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Napoleon’s capture led to the establishment of a moderate Republican government in Paris led by Adolphe Thiers. Through a combination of a succession of military defeats and a poor allocation of food leading to starvation in Paris, an armed contingent of the working class in the national guard became increasingly restive.  Socialist journalists and agitators such as Louis Charles Delescluze began to gain popularity by denouncing the government for their incompetence. Officers became increasingly perturbed as army units ordered to fire on crowds instead fraternised with the masses and the provisional government set out to disarm them. These manoeuvres  led to officers being arrested or shot, the construction of barricades and large parts of the city under the effective control of a new self-organised regime, in opposition to Thiers. The government fled to Versailles, about twenty kilometres outside the city, and a Central Committee was formed which produced a manifesto calling for elections, control over the police, magistrates, freedom of the press, public meetings and association, the expropriation of articles of primary necessity, their allocation according to need and the arming of citizens.</p>
<p>The leaders of the commune were primarily followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the influence of Marx was far outweighed by followers of Proudhon, as anarchism was then gaining influence within the International Workingmen’s Association. In addition to the anarchists there was a significant number of opportunists which led to a vagueness of aims and a proneness to grandiose declarations over practical action. One of the most significant of these was the commune’s seemingly principled refusal to seize the money in Parisian bank vaults. As participant-observer of the commune Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray writes: ‘While abolishing their budget of public worship, which was at Versailles, they bent their knees to the budget of the bourgeoisie, which was at their mercy’. Another failure Lissagaray identifies was delaying a march on the government in Versailles for three weeks, which gave Thiers ample time to prepare a regular army which was able to repeal the ill-prepared, under-equipped and indisciplined forces of the commune.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Commune was crushed by the regular army after two months, in a week-long campaign of brutal counter-insurgency during which thousands were killed and wounded. The extent of the commune’s internal divisions, its concern with emphasising its legitimacy, rendered it unable to maintain the first assembly in history in which more than a quarter of the representatives were workers, over the long term.</p>
<p>Though the influence of Marx’s thought was minimal, and only very few committed Marxists were participants, Marx understood the importance of the commune, following and documenting its progress over the weeks it unfolded. Marx did so not just because it made his name notorious throughout Europe and his being cited in the reactionary press as its primary orchestrator, which he noted with some satisfaction in his correspondence, but because of  the innovative nature of its civic and legislative assemblies, with elected representatives subject to instant recall if they violated the popular will. These institutions, constructed from below institutions represented as far the future historical and political development of human society, as he expressed in a letter to Ludwig Kugelmann. Marx wrote The Civil War in France (1871) in order to extract lessons of the commune for the benefit of the International and for future socialist movements. In this work we find Marx’s theory of the state, with its military, police and bureaucracy, which first developed under feudalism, transformed over time into an instrument for enforcing the interests of the bourgeois capitalist class. The future of a society led by a proletarian government did not lie in taking control of this instrument in the expectation that it could be bent to progressive ends, but rather in smashing it. Vladimir Lenin, in exile from a provisional government under pressure from the proletariat and peasantry returned to this work and elaborated on it for the purposes of the Russian working class in State and Revolution (1917).</p>
<p>The emergence of the Paris Commune in France would seem to have validated the schema by which Marx regarded the course of human societies and their development. It was in France, Germany and Britain that the bourgeoisie first began to accumulate capital, assert itself within the state and exploit the maturing working class. It would therefore stand to reason that the collective consciousness of the toilers would take shape in these places, begin to form mass organisations and build a new society to overthrow the existing order. As with everything in Marx this is of course subject to disclaimers; both Marx and Engels were increasingly interested in Russia towards the end of their lives, noting the significantly greater amounts of overt forms of state coercion than were in evidence in Europe as a crucial component in creating a revolutionary situation and the ways in which it may be possible for a relatively underdeveloped society to leap over the stage of the bourgeois revolution he initially regarded as a necessity, and advance straight to socialism. Though he doubtless had significant disagreements with the anarchist narodnik or populist movements then attempting to propagandise among the peasantry for the formation of collective agriculture, he did take note of them.</p>
<p>Ultimately the historical events which unfolded were more complicated. Enormous labour struggles did happen in the west and secured significant gains but revolutions which brought about comprehensive changes in the social order happened in nations like Ireland, China, Cuba and Algeria. Looking at the balance sheet of the twentieth century, it is clear that the number of revolutions in underdeveloped nations far outnumber those which took place in the heart of imperialism and one of the reasons this has been the case is precisely the robustness of the state apparatus that Marx placed so much emphasis on. The precise forms of political legitimacy which took shape in nations with a strong indigenous bourgeoisie were ultimately too strong for the revolutionary sections of the labour movement to overcome. In colonial contexts, as well as smaller imperial nations, the middle class were weak; they were constrained from developing to full capacity because they had come late to the process of industrialisation. According to the terms of capitalism as it existed, they could not compete with the prime movers of the global market, at least not within the constraints of free trade. Resultantly, significant constituencies composed of peasants, landless labourers and industrial workers, employed on a far more precarious basis and without access to representative institutions or welfare states, continued to endure in places such as these.</p>
<p>Alexander Parvus described Russia at the outset of the twentieth century as an economically backward society; existing in a condition of uneven and combined development. This meant that there was an emergent and growing proletariat in the factories in the cities but also an enormous rural peasantry, living in what was more or less a medieval context, culturally, economically and politically. What financial capital had developed was overwhelmingly in the form of foreign investment. In addition to this, the Russian army was weak; under-equipped, under-resourced and in comparison to those of western states, unorganised.</p>
<p>The authentically proletarian representative institutions which Marx laid such emphasis on in the Paris commune re-appeared amidst the collapse of state authority in Russia, in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, with the formation of Soviets. As operationalised in the Russian context context, these are bodies which are pulled together across all sections of society, with delegations of particular factories or districts as well as peasants councils from the countryside. As long as they existed in Russia, they attested to the capacity of the masses to enact their own conditions of freedom, to an extent that has not since been seen at any stage in human history since.</p>
<p>If the political coalition under Charles Stewart Parnell had been successful in securing Home Rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century there would perhaps have been an opportunity for Ireland to remain within the union on a similar basis to the status of the six counties after partition, shoring up a new Catholic establishment within a reformed dispensation. Similarly, there are a significant number of points in the years running up to the Russian Revolution in which Tsar Nicholas II could have stepped to one side, allowed the more rational and sustainable form of governance in the Dumas to attain greater power, to allow administrators such as Sergei Witte to conclude state-subsidised developmental projects, but, instead the Tsar taking a role emblematic of the many instances in Russia from 1904 – 1917 attesting to the power that it is possible for single individuals to wield over the course of world historical events, refuses to do so. It is precisely for these and other reasons, such as the brutality of the secret police, the deployment of the army against striking workers that the Russian Social Democracy, as opposed to European wings, did not seek a compromise with capital within the state, but rather brought the revolution to its successful conclusion under the leadership of Lenin, who often had to face down significant internal resistance from party colleagues in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were not aiming to establish a single socialist regime in Russia which would happily co-exist with the European capitalist powers. All figures whose later disagreements were to determine the course of events for as long as the state existed, from Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Grigori Zinoviev, all regarded this as the necessary development in order to break through the contradictions and limitations of the Soviet economy. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had spent significant periods of time in Europe or the United States in exile from Tsarist autocracy and had been involved in revolutionary émigré organisations. They regarded themselves as the vanguard of an international and irrevocable historical movement towards working-class power  on an international basis and without a European revolution on the horizon, to hold down the fort until this was accomplished. In pursuit of this end once they had taken power Leon Trotsky set about a diplomatic strategy as the USSR’s commissar of Foreign Affairs, calling upon the workers of Europe to rise against their leaders by publishing secret treaties negotiated between the capitalist leaders against the interests of their working class. Ultimately this strategy did not work. The German Revolution, which is probably rightly regarded as a significant hinge point that might have broken the isolation of the Soviet government and opened up a path whereby forced collectivisation may have been enacted in a manner that less coercive. As it was, the exigencies of existing as an isolated regime in an antagonistic world system, which encircled, invaded and boycotted them made appealing over the heads of governments in order to stoke the militancy of the masses, as during the English general strike in 1926, an awkward proposition.</p>
<p>Not only are there far more revolutions in underdeveloped nations but their class character seems to become far more ambivalent as struggles for national liberation seem to shape the course of world events far more than proletarian internationalism. The most important reasons for this was the United States entering into global capitalist hegemony in the aftermath of World War II. In order to prevent the enormously popular European communist parties capitalising on their anti-fascist credentials, no thanks to the official policies of the Comintern, the US re-shapes Europe in its own image as a market for its own exports. The most robust welfare states being constructed in imperialist nations is most comprehensible in this setting, a mechanism for moderating disenchantment with the post-war dispensation. More overtly coercive forms of counter-insurgency were also visited on nations of the global south, with mass killings being inflicted on peoples in Guatemala, Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. In this sense, claims that nation rather than class has been the primary engine of human history is to overlook the nation as a key means through which class is mediated under imperialism. It is often socialists that we find playing key roles within the most radical factions within these movements because as socialists and anti-imperialists they understand that the task of constructing socialism is an international one that requires its being challenged at multiple points simultaneously.</p>
<p>One of the key diplomatic strategies for the USSR in the postwar period was to push against the expansion of the US where it could, supporting and encouraging the growth of these anti-colonial regimes; for example, the USSR purchases goods from Cuba under a US blockade at prices well below those of the international market. Such gestures were often far more opportunistic than they were principled and sometimes even more of a liability than a help, as Fidel Castro experienced in their attempts to export revolution to Angola and repel South African offensives into Namibia.</p>

			<description>When reading Sally Rooney’s novels I wonder whether or not she is doing the same thing as Joanna Hogg or Harmony Korine, wherein something vacuous and / or vulgar is being represented as a comment on societal vulgarity and vacuousness or whether those being represented, whether upper-class English people or lower-class Americans, are intended to be in and of themselves, sympathetic or interesting. The answer is always both, but I think Beautiful World Where Are You represents a turning point in Rooney’s writing career at which the central point is indeed that we find academically high-achieving and precocious people who attended Trinity College Dublin sympathetic and interesting.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When reading Sally Rooney’s novels I wonder whether or not she is doing the same thing as Joanna Hogg or Harmony Korine, wherein something vacuous and / or vulgar is being represented as a comment on societal vulgarity and vacuousness or whether those being represented, whether upper-class English people or lower-class Americans, are intended to be in and of themselves, sympathetic or interesting. The answer is always both, but I think Beautiful World Where Are You represents a turning point in Rooney’s writing career at which the central point is indeed that we find academically high-achieving and precocious people who attended Trinity College Dublin sympathetic and interesting.</p>
<p>There are at least four distinct narrative modes within this novel.</p>
<p>i. mimetic depictions of how characters sit, where they are looking, what’s on their phone screen, how they hang their clothes up or don’t, whether or not they uncoil the cables of phone chargers. These sections are more surface than depth. Nothing is, rather they appear or suggest; there is a constitutive tenativeness at work here, especially in instances in which someone appearing to be nonchalant as a pretense to feeling some other way would be of little or no consequence.</p>
<p>ii. sections in which Eileen and Alice, the two central characters, send emails to one another, discussing relationships, both former and prior, reflect on how they feel, how they appear to themselves, how they appear to others and how others appear to them. Into this come also the novels’ ideas, such as right-wing politics, civilisational collapse and the felt biological need to have babies. The extended treatment of ideas at length represent a difference from previous works; Frances and Bobbi’s intellectual or politics interests in Conversations with Friends were exclusively a function of having scandalous things to say in company.</p>
<p>iii. dialogue.</p>
<p>iv. retrospective exposition. To paraphrase; ‘Eileen’s sister played sports at school’, ‘Alice and Eileen would eat toast together long into the night’, ‘Eileen won all the academic prizes for which she was eligible’. This is only mode in which the reader moves back and forth in time.</p>
<p>Though self-consciousness is common to ii. and iii. and ideas come through in dialogue as well as emails I would not suggest that we are in the territory of free indirect discourse. Instead there is a more or less absolute cordon sanitaire cleaving one from the other. This is not to the works’ benefit, read alone the clunkiness present in ii. is undeniable:</p>
<p>‘My theory is that human beings lost the instinct for beauty in 1976 when plastics became the most widespread material in existence. You can actually see the change in process if you look at street photography from before and after 1976. I know we have good reason to be sceptical of aesthetic nostalgia but the fact remains that before the 1970’s people wore durable clothes of wool and cotton, stored drinks in glass bottles, wrapped food produce in paper and filled their houses with sturdy wooden furniture. Now the majority of objects in our visual environment is made of plastic, the ugliest substance on earth. A material which, when dyed does not assume colour but rather exudes colour in an inimitability ugly way. One thing a government could do…is to prohibit the production of every form of plastic not necessary for the maintenance of human life’.</p>
<p>This paragraph and others would prompt me to think that we are firmly in the territory of Korine-Hogg, that the Kantian readings of social relations or human history are intended to transgress against our attention, or, as other critics have suggested, keep those who have showed up for the sex, or didn’t think Marxism was cool a decade ago at arms-length, given that the Anglo-American novel is in something of a golden age in terms of the number of ideas about late capitalism or modernity being ventriloquised, as in autofiction, essay fiction, theory fiction, creative non-fiction, whatever we want to call it. Whatever we might think of these works – and their class biases, originality and elitism have been litigated in many articles and reviews – I think its fair to say that one of their distinguishing features are their success in dovetailing the fictive and non-fictive with a certain amount of formal elegance.</p>
<p>Splitting the boundaries between these distinct modes might have allowed for a greater amount of resolution in both, or pointed a way beyond the relentless struggle within each character’s minds between politics and individuality such that they may not need to be led towards the submission and sacrifice available to them in Catholicism. This turn is interesting to read at a time in which reproductive rights are increasingly a political flashpoint. Lauren Oyler, in a recent article in the London Review of Books, seems to despair of the growth of a counter-cultural Catholicism and though no doubt numerically negligible it’s still not nearly as rare as I would like, particularly in Ireland. The implicit contention in Beautiful World Where Are You that Jesus is a bit Marxist while jettisoning everything that makes the established Catholic Church what it is cursory, and unconvincing. Allowing the emails to speak more to the novel’s matter might also have done for its non-specificity, there is an email that considers the topography of Dublin’s relative freedom from architectural fedual remnants and whether or not this makes its topography more democratic than those on the continent. Even within the context of the novel itself this is a mad thing to say, the scandal of Dublin’s rental market is represented and compared unfavourably to Paris. The apocalypticism of right-wing politics are a frequent touchstone but a reference to a British politician making an offensive statement on Bloody Sunday remains just that.</p>
<p>In each of Rooney’s novels the supposed disagreeableness and fervency of particular characters will comfortably alongside their popularity and brilliance. I look forward to seeing if Rooney will try to introduce a greater amount of friction between these two poles in her future works.</p>

			<description>A friend of mine described a short story in Adrian Duncan’s 2021 collection Midfield Dynamo as ‘like John McGahern with the humanity stripped out of it’. If you read McGahern’s works in chronological order you can see this humanity begin to edge out the harshness and repetition elsewhere, or at least begin to assert itself more often as a necessary opposite. The last line of McGahern’s last novel is essentially a pitch for a comprehensive transcendence or transformation, a conclusion which I once heard a relative describe as ‘too easy’.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine described a short story in Adrian Duncan’s 2021 collection Midfield Dynamo as ‘like John McGahern with the humanity stripped out of it’. If you read McGahern’s works in chronological order you can see this humanity begin to edge out the harshness and repetition elsewhere, or at least begin to assert itself more often as a necessary opposite. The last line of McGahern’s last novel is essentially a pitch for a comprehensive transcendence or transformation, a conclusion which I once heard a relative describe as ‘too easy’.</p>
<p>The essential difference between McGahern and Duncan lies in the distinct nature of the labour depicted in their works. While McGahern’s is the world of the small farmer, what he referred to as the little Republics woven into self-sustaining rural communities, Duncan’s characters, particularly those engineers central to The Geometer Lobachevsky, are the vanguard of this world’s dissolution. An intuition in dialogue with geometry and mathematics is the more ambivalent route Duncan takes, as opposed to the seasons or natural world through which McGahern gains access to something beyond. Duncan does allow for a dignity, self-realisation or orientation becoming possible through work, but just as often it leads to failure, confusion or death.</p>
<p>The plot centres around a Russian geometer, Nikolai Lobachevsky, who travels to the Irish midlands in the fifties to assist a man named Rhatigan in surveying a bog. Lobachevsky attempts to explain how the uneven and mobile surface of the landscape complicates its mapping but the elaborate way in which he tries to do so fails and renders him an object of mockery in the area. Any social ties which arise in Lobachevsky’s movements from the midlands and out west seem uncertain and may well be artefacts of Lobachevsky turning over his daily routines in his mind, slipping out of his alienation in self-forgetfulness.</p>
<p>In a conversation with the architect Emmet Scanlon, Duncan described his research into Free State’s initial attempts at becoming a developmental state and this seems to represent a significant source of inspiration for The Geometer Lobachevsky. Electrification, Ardnacrusha and industrialised extraction of peat all significantly complicate that notion propagated by the postwar intelligentsia of the Free State, that Ireland was an ignorant, navel-gazing rural backwater. The acclaim Duncan’s works have secured to date has in large part to do with how unique themes such as state-formation and infrastructure are, not just in contemporary Irish literature but I think literature in general. Though I haven’t read nearly as much Russian literature as I would like to, I am totally unaware of any other work in which the ambivalence of being a technocrat in a specific post-revolutionary context is treated with this level of seriousness.</p>
<p>Means of securing buy-in from the existing administrators of Tsarism was a consistent problem for the Bolsheviks once the Russian proletariat had overthrown Kerensky’s Provisional Government, while in the Free State the situation was very different, there being a significant amount of continuity between Ireland under the British and the Free State. Cumann na nGaedhal, a pro-Treaty party whose social base was derived from large farmers and southern unionists, made no attempt to construct a state which might compete with British capitalism, but rather sought to faciliate it, committing itself to extreme fiscal rectitude to suppress domestic demand and subsidising large farmers who exported their agricultural products to Britain, effectively condeming the landless and labouring elements who had been most active in seeking to secure Irish independence during the Tan war to degredation, unemployment and emigration.</p>
<p>The continuity of British institutionality was maintained despite the large number of Irishmen already working in administrative roles; the main criticism voiced by senior civil servants was that their inherited system deviated too far from the British model. C.J. Gregg, a personal friend of William Cosgrave, was leased in from London’s Board of Inland Revenue to lead the committee which formulated the final recommendations for the Free State’s reorganised government. Gregg not only favoured retaining the title ‘The Treasury’ for the Department of Finance, but also attempted to secure a role for the Department over and above that of the elected cabinet. Just as the state enforced this regime from above it is important to remember that Local Appointments Boards dominated by the church hierarchy also played its role in stifling the emergence of a indigenous technocracy. In this way Irish professionals were oriented within a reformed Empire; the new establishment in which Rhatigan envisions himself has no need for qualifications or professionals, just intermediaries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there are a number of premonitions of the coming order in which the state’s investments will become more international in character; old triangulations through which Ireland was mapped relative to Britain are being severed and the new ones will serve to lift Ireland three metres out of the sea. Rhatigan’s observation that ‘Accuracy’s children have devoured their parents’, channels Stephen Dedalus’ sow that eats her own farrow, an axiom that might be said to underpin the vast majority of historiography written on the post-revolutionary orders in both the USSR as well as the Irish Free State. I find Rhatigan’s phrasing of the issue more convincing; not just because it repudiates these clichés as well as Joyce’s Viconian perspective, but because it captures the pressures bearing down upon Ireland and their distance from historic Republic aspiration.</p>
<p>We also see the section of the state which remain as yet unsubsumed when Lobachevsky spends a period of time working with Irish speaking labourers harvesting seaweed. Lobachevsky is not invited to assist in the more involved aspects of their labour, or is only allowed to do so under close scrutiny, as though they fear, correctly, the steady erosion of their way of life. Lobachevsky actually witnesses a synecdoche of this process take place in overhearing a conversation as two people ‘speak for some moments in Irish with shreds of English weaved through…and the shreds of English grow into sentences that overcome the collapsing strings then atoms of Irish they were speaking’.</p>
<p>One significant difference between the way in which the Free State and the USSR is framed comes in the form of the representation of the Bolsheviks, who appear as thugs or boors, while the local enforcers of the Free State regime are absent. We have a representation of the Romanovs’ executions (whose barbarism went far, far beyond anything undertaken by the Soviets) and this at least emphasises the violence inherent in the changing of the guard; civil war legacies of summary executions, military tribunals and atrocities are mediated exclusively within a ‘brother against brother’ paradigm. Looking at the two political formations which arose out of the civil war we see that these divisions tended to fall far more along family and class lines rather than through them; the scenario represented in The Wind that Shakes the Barley is more the exception than the rule.</p>
<p>Threading the themes I’ve touched upon here will involve spoiling the ending of the novel, so I’ll conclude by saying that Duncan’s refusal to make things ‘too easy’, to turn away from the furrow he works towards the rising sun, is what makes his work so unique and essential. Read this book, and all his others.</p>

			<description>Prelude to the Rising
Thomas Clarke was born in 1858 to an Irish family living in Hampshire in England. His father was in the British army and was briefly stationed in South Africa before the family returned to Dungannon in County Tyrone, where Clarke became involved in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret society founded by the Fenians in 1858 to advance the cause of Irish separatism. Imprisoned for fifteen years for his role in an incendiary bombing campaign in London, Clarke emigrated to the United States, where he re-founded the IRB with Patrick McCartan and Denis McCullough.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prelude to the Rising</p>
<p>Thomas Clarke was born in 1858 to an Irish family living in Hampshire in England. His father was in the British army and was briefly stationed in South Africa before the family returned to Dungannon in County Tyrone, where Clarke became involved in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret society founded by the Fenians in 1858 to advance the cause of Irish separatism. Imprisoned for fifteen years for his role in an incendiary bombing campaign in London, Clarke emigrated to the United States, where he re-founded the IRB with Patrick McCartan and Denis McCullough. When Clarke returned to Ireland, he did so with the aim of cultivating a new generation of Irish revolutionaries, turning them away from collaboration with the Irish Parliamentary Party under John Redmond, whose influence was at its peak. In 1912 the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith struck a bargain with Redmond, that Irish Home Rule would be granted if the IPP voted for his finance bill; effectively promising Ireland devolved powers within the British Empire. This set in motion a chain of events which would allow Clarke’s far more marginal organisation to eclipse Redmond’s in the struggle for Irish independence.</p>
<p>Once Home Rule was on the horizon, Irishmen loyal to the British crown, primarily but not exclusively in northern parts of the country, began to organise against its introduction. Leaders of the campaign — the barrister Edward Carson and politician James Craig — spoke at meetings of the Orange Order, a Protestant supremacist organisation whose founding dates back to the 1798 revolution and attacks which were conducted organisations allied with the United Irishmen. Carson and Craig encouraged the Protestant population to boycott their Catholic neighbours and stirred them up into rioting. On 28 September 1912 Carson led thousands of unionists to sign the Solemn League and Covenant, which pledged that all signatories would resist the introduction of Home Rule by any and all means. In 1913 these loyalist militias, armed and trained by British amy officers, were brought within the umbrella of the Ulster Volunteer Force. In response to loyalist activism Asquith declared any county within Ireland in which a majority of electors opposed Home Rule would be allowed to opt out and thus the foundations for the stifling of Irish democracy via partition were laid.</p>
<p>The IRB began to recruit a volunteer army to challenge this loyalist threat. Six months after it began accepting recruits, it had acquired almost 200,000 members and had succeeded in procuring 900 rifles. Redmond, concerned that his control over the national movement would be undermined by the Volunteers, demanded twenty-three of his appointees be placed on the governing committee. Though the Volunteers accepted Redmond’s ultimatum in order to prevent a split in the movement their magnanimity was not to be rewarded. Once the Home Rule bill was passed — accompanied by a suspensory act that required it to be ratified by Westminster an additional time — Redmond split the Volunteers himself by declaring that in order to prove their capacity for self-rule, the Irish should enlist in the British army and fight for Empire. More than 90% of the Volunteers did enlist but a more militant cadre repudiated Redmond and seized the Volunteer offices in collaboration with James Connolly’s Citizen Army, an organisation founded to protect striking workers from crown forces and armed scabs during the 1913 Lockout. In the general atmosphere of imperial sentiment that marked the outbreak of the war these Volunteers were regarded with bemusement and sometimes hostility. In his memoir Victory and Woe: The West Limerick Brigade in the War of Independence, Mossie Harnett writes that just a few weeks before the Easter Rising, soldiers’ wives threw rotten eggs at marching volunteers. In his memoir of the War of Independence, On Another Man’s Wound, Ernie O’Malley records his own scepticism, seeing them as insufficiently brave to fight overseas and therefore unlikely to fight at home.</p>
<p>As the mass slaughter on the western front began to dampen Irish enthusiasm for the war effort and the British began to consider moving against the Volunteers in order to more smoothly implement conscription, Clarke, together with other members of the IRB Military Council such as Éamon Ceannt, Seán MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Padraig Pearse and Joseph Plunkett informed Connolly of their plans for an insurrection on Easter Sunday of 1916. The leader of the Volunteers, professor and Irish cultural nationalist Eoin MacNeill, would not have agreed to pre-empt conscription’s introduction and would only support engaging the British defensively. In order to force his hand, the IRB forged a document appearing to be an internal memorandum from Dublin Castle calling for the arrests of the Volunteer leadership. Once MacNeill learned that this document had been forged and that a shipment of German arms intended for the Volunteers had been intercepted by the British navy, he issued a countermanding order. This order went far wider than anyone on the IRB expected, MacNeill even succeeded in publishing it in the newspapers. The IRB decided to proceed with the Rising, but to postpone it until the following day. The IRB attempted to inform volunteers outside Dublin that the Rising had only been postponed, but this was in large part unsuccessful, many volunteers had already destroyed their arms or uniforms.</p>
<p>The main garrison occupied by the Volunteers was the General Post Office on O’Connell Street, Dublin’s main thoroughfare and the forces there were under the command of Connolly, Clarke, Pearse and Plunkett. The 1st battalion occupied the Four Courts, the 2nd Battalion Jacob’s Biscuit Factory, Eamon DeValera led the third battalion in Boland’s Mills and the fourth occupied the South Dublin Union. Connolly’s Citizen Army, who the countermanding order did not affect, were divided between Stephen’s Green, City Hall and the GPO. Telegraph wires were cut, bridges and railway lines blown up to delay the arrival of British reinforcements forces but by Tuesday crown forces had begun to come in from the Curragh and Dun Laoghaire.</p>
<p>The original plan for the Rising was to form a circle around the Four Courts and to send out lines to connect with forces coming from other parts of country, but the reduction in Volunteer numbers had decided the Rising would be an unsuccessful confrontation with the British from the outset. By Thursday much of O’Connell Street was on fire due to the British gunship Helga on the River Liffey and the roof of the GPO was on the brink of collapse. All the women were evacuated, with the exception of Elizabeth O’Farrell, Winifred Carney and Connolly’s nurse, who all refused to leave. At a meeting of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic at its new garrison on Moore Street, Clarke favoured fighting on, but in order to prevent further loss of life among the Volunteers, a surrender document was issued, signed by Pearse and Connolly to ensure the other garrisons would step down.</p>
<p>The newspapers variously reported the Rising as being communist, suffragette or German in nature. The executions of Clarke, Pearse and MacDonagh were cheered on by the bourgeois presses and William Martin Murphy, a business magnate whose anti-union practices had been challenged by Connolly’s Irish Transport and General Worker’s Union three years before, called for the execution of Connolly in particular. On 3 May Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke were executed by firing squad followed by Plunkett the following day. On 8 May Ceannt and Connolly were shot and on 12 May MacDiarmada followed. The British initially planned to execute ninety Volunteers, but stopped as broader opinion began to swing in favour of the revolutionaries, with Redmondites branded as murderers for cheering on the terror.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin Comes to Power</p>
<p>Though the Sinn Féin organisation founded by journalist and monarchist Arthur Griffith had nothing to do with the Rising, it was to be the primary political beneficiary as, not for the first or last time, the incompetent response of the British to Irish liberation struggles succeeded in installing otherwise marginal political actors in a pantheon of Irish patriots alongside Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet. Three thousand Volunteers, teachers, writers, journalists and Gaelic Leaguers regarded as sympathetic to the cause of Irish separatism were imprisoned. Prison sentences were handed down to civilians carrying Sinn Féin flags or whistling rebel songs, further eroding the space that existed for the IPP’s pursuit of dominion status within the Empire. Count Plunkett, father of the executed leader of 1916, won a by-election in Roscommon in February 1917. While Plunkett seemed likely to secure a leading role in Sinn Féin, he was eclipsed by De Valera, who stood on a 1916 platform in another by-election in Clare. Joe McGuinness, a Gaelic Leaguer who was deported and imprisoned in Britain for his role in the Four Courts, was put forward as a candidate in a Longford by-election, beating the IPP candidate Patrick McKenna. In the 1918 election Sinn Féin won 73 of 101 seats, but instead of taking them in Westminster, they formed a new clandestine parliament in Dublin, aiming to appeal to the Paris Peace Conference for recognition of the Irish Republic over and above the heads of the British. As internees received amnesties large crowds gathered to meet them as they arrived in Dublin, underlining the extent of the support which now existed for Sinn Féin. When the IRB member Thomas Ashe, murdered in prison while on hunger strike for political status, tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral.</p>
<p>The British response to the Rising was of course not the sole reason for this transformation of the political landscape. The work of Irish Republican women in Cumann na mBan did much to create the situation in which 80 new branches across the nation seeking affiliation with Sinn Féin were established. Crucial too was a longer process of cultural development through organisations such as the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association, through which folk memories of cultural difference and an anti-imperialist tradition were preserved and renewed. Harnett refers to an awareness he had growing up of an ancestor Muiris Ó’h-Airtnéide who was in involved in Fenian resistance to the Famine. Dan Breen recalls his neighbours’ ‘exultation over the victories gained by the Boer Generals…how thrilled they were by the British defeat at Spion Top’. Education provided by Irish-speaking teachers or older relatives are often cited by military leaders within the IRA as formative, though there were others who came from more apolitical backgrounds. Tom Barry describes joining the British Army not because Redmond had told him to, but because he wanted to see what war was like. O’Malley’s background was middle-class and seonín. The political development of these men took place in the years after the Rising, amidst mass campaigns and general strikes against conscription. O’Malley describes reading in Republican newspapers about what the men of 1916 had fought for and Connolly’s Labour in Irish History while Barry records his repudiation of his education dominated by British monarchs, reading about Eoghan Ruadh, Patrick Sarsfield and John Mitchel.</p>
<p>The number of Volunteers rose to over 100,000 in response to the renewal of internment on the pretext that the Volunteers were fifth columnists loyal to the Germans. The British also banned the GAA and arrested Sinn Féin’s most prominent leaders. In De Valera’s absence the influence of a Corkman named Michael Collins on the Supreme Council of the IRB grew. The presence of a secret society at a high level within the Republican movement was an ongoing point of contention for a number of senior figures within the IRA, including Breen and 1916 veteran Cathal Brugha. Sinn Féin organised itself to outflank the British, misdirecting authorities through decoy meetings and building institutional power in the form of a functioning administration through courts, tax collectors, a postal service and a civic police force in areas from which the British had been ejected. Sentences from these courts varied from fines, to a demand that both sides agree to shake hands, to parading the guilty outside chapel gates on Sunday with their offences written on pieces of cardboard tied around their necks. All this was sustained through subscriptions, sporadic donations secured from the population, obtained with varying degrees of willingness or consent, as documented in Patrick O’Sullivan Greene’s Crowdfunding the Irish Revolution. Representatives of the Irish Republic also presented themselves abroad; once his escape from prison had been arranged De Valera toured the United States in order to raise money and draw on the support of Irish Americans. Cumann na mBan members such Nora Connolly, Margaret Skinnider and suffragette Hannah Sheehy Skeffington were central to these endeavours, using speaking tours as a rallying point for anti-imperialist activism in the United States. These diplomatic missions were rarely successful; even with the help of the labour movement the American administration valued its relationship with Britain far more than the nascent Irish Republic.</p>
<p>Breen was one of the Volunteers in the 3rd Tipperary Brigade who, impatient with the moderate and constitutional approach of Sinn Féin, engaged the British militarily at Soloheadbeg towards the end of January. Two British soldiers were killed in the course of the ambush, which was planned in order to intercept a consignment of gelignite. Sinn Féin initially offered no support; Minister for Defence Richard Mulcahy referred to the men as murderers. Breen admits that there was no majority in favour of fighting the British at this stage, but once crown forces began to mete out draconian punishments upon the broader population in response to IRA ambushes, this began to change. When Constable Michael Enright and Sergeant Peter Wallace were shot during the rescue of Seán Hogan from the custody of Royal Irish Constabulary, a Kilmallock jury in Limerick refused to return a guilty verdict demanding instead self-determination for the Irish people. This dynamic, whereby the Sinn Féin leadership would find themselves out of step with a broader and more Republican mass sentiment, was to become a fixture of the Irish Revolutionary period. There was often suspicion among the small farmers and workers who in large part waged the armed campaigns of the party bureaucrats in Dublin whose primary interest was in maintaining Sinn Féin as a constitutional force. The determination of local leaders to not have to take orders from central government was another, more concrete reason for this contradiction.</p>
<p>The British proscribed the Republic’s institutions and began recruiting ex-servicemen into auxiliary units in 1920, once the extent to which the RIC had lost their legitimacy had become clear. These auxiliaries, or Black and Tans, aimed to choke off the IRA’s access to accommodation, food, intelligence and assistance from the civilian population by driving into towns, firing randomly, ordering civilians out of doors, stripping men and beating them with rifle butts, commandeering food, torturing IRA members, destroying farm equipment, confiscating vehicles or just shooting and lynching civilians for fun. The wanton sadism of the auxiliaries only served to boost Sinn Féin’s legitimacy further among a population, who became increasingly willing to feed and shelter revolutionaries and uphold boycotts of the police or businessmen sympathetic to British rule.</p>
<p>The IRA, making no effort to emulate the structure of a conventional army, adopted an elastic structure, dividing into companies and then sections, which varied in seize from fifty to one hundred, depending on population, terrain, personnel and available resources. Officers were elected by ballot and military engagements were embarked upon only when it was more or less certain that more casualties would be inflicted than sustained. As is usually the case in irregular warfare the civil and political aspects of the conflict took on a greater importance. Barry’s account of the countryside in West Cork emphasises the class composition of the area, particularly with regard to the Big Houses of the Protestant Ascendancy, a cohort of large merchants and landlords. These were not only concrete historic documents of the acquisition of land and labour by imperial conquest, their social position secured by the Penal Laws and the Act of Union, but also one of the primary means through which the British gathered intelligence in the area. Beneath the Ascendancy there were the smaller merchants, among whom were some Catholics afforded a share in the dividends of Empire, as well as retired British naval and army officers. Billeting and procuring food and accommodation at loyalist homes allowed the IRA to monitor potential British assets and alleviate the pressure on more sympathetic elements of the population where food, shelter or warmth were more likely to be scarce. Barry established a habit of having the men manoeuvre in demesne land to rid them of a taught deference to the landed gentry, underlining some of the more pragmatic aspects of decolonisation understood as an internal or psychological process. Barry records instructing those who were identified as spies and informers to leave the country within 24 hours, their land divided into the hands of the landless labourers or taken into the Republican administration, although there were also many instances in which they were summarily executed. The benefits of these sentences, cutting off the Brits from their intelligence networks as well as setting an example to others unsympathetic to the Irish Republic, had to be balanced against maintaining sympathy among the broader population; mercy could and sometimes was shown to British soldiers who were known to have not executed or mistreated any prisoners. Fortified posts as well as buildings commandeered by the Black and Tans were obvious targets for the IRA though unlike most volunteers, the Black and Tans had experience of warfare and ample resources in the form of artillery, machine guns or armoured vehicles. The extent of the achievement of a largely unarmed unprofessional army, its leaders deriving what expertise they had via military textbooks or journals, training in secret, carrying out successful operations on fortified posts using the few arms they had acquired, sometimes without ammunition or unreliable grenades improvised from tins with scrap metal and gelignite, under the acute stress brought about by hunger, long marches across rough terrain and weather is almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin in Power</p>
<p>Sinn Féin had been an umbrella movement which, under very specific circumstances, had brought together monarchists, nationalists and Republican separatists within a single unified front for national liberation. Once serious discussions about the precise nature of the Irish state being struggled for began to be posed, as in the Treaty negotiations which followed May 1921 truce, these different factions within the organisation entered into open conflict. Cumann na mBan member Mary MacSwiney detected a more conciliatory tone among the leadership around this time, noting that Collins did not make any reference to the Republic while delivering a speech in Armagh. Those Republicans who were later to take up arms against the Free State recall the appearance of newspaper articles outlining the benefits of dominion status, the nature of the Commonwealth membership enjoyed by Canadians and the impossibility of renewing the armed struggle. Republicans such as O’Malley and Dinny Kelly who fought in Tipperary, record similar sentiments being broadcast among those who had joined the army after the ceasefire; these factions were referred to as ‘truceleers’.</p>
<p>Liam Mellows, veteran of the abortive 1916 Rising in Galway, expected negotiations with the British to break down and continued his work in procuring arms from overseas. This wavering of confidence in the capacity of the constitutional movement to deliver the Republic was present also among the leadership, with Brugha refusing to form part of the Irish delegation. Collins, Griffith, Secretary of State Robert Barton, E.J. Duggan, T.D. for the constituency of Louth-Meath and Gavan Duffy, T.D. for Dublin County, ultimately formed the delegation. President De Valera’s reserve status allowed him to periodically intervene to make demands upon the plenipotentiaries, to their frustration. There were further divisions within the negotiating team itself; confidential discussions took place between Collins, Griffith and the British cabinet and on certain issues they made common cause with the British against the others, as when Griffiths corresponded with Lloyd George about the role the British monarch might have in Irish affairs. Much has been written on whether or not De Valera, having some sense in advance that the British would not grant a Republic, sent Collins and Griffith so that blame for the inevitable compromise would fall on them, but no direct evidence of such arithmetic exists. I personally find De Valera’s naive faith in his legislative hypothetical of ‘external association’ a more convincing explanation for his actions than Machiavellianism.</p>
<p>The objectives of the British cabinet were obvious; allowing the Irish to leave the Empire would strengthen the hand of independence movements in India and Egypt. The British had also been pro-active in securing their position in the north up to this point; the 1920 Government of Ireland Act created the statelet of ‘Northern Ireland’ from the counties of Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone. The loyalists’ demand for six counties, as opposed to the nine counties of Ulster, was based on their calculating that they would not be able to maintain control of the Catholic majorities beyond those of Fermanagh and Tyrone. Over the summer of 1920 loyalist leaders had encouraged pogroms against Catholics which began in Belfast and continued sporadically over a number of weeks. By the end of the summer 16 Catholics had been killed and nearly 200 houses and shops burned. A boycott of goods from unionist firms in Belfast was passed in the Dáil.</p>
<p>The Articles of Agreement placed significant limitations on Irish self-determination. They allowed Britain to retain control of Irish ports, required all parliamentarians in the Dáil to swear an oath of allegiance to the British monarch and did not bring about any change in the imposed border. Personal allegiances, loyalty to regional commanders as well as opinions expressed by constituents, were as important as political principle in deciding what side one came down on as opposed to another. Many accounts report the saying ‘What is good enough for Mick Collins, is good enough for me’ entering into general circulation. De Valera and Brugha were the most prominent anti-Treaty figures within Sinn Féin, though they were in no way leading this tendency; Republicans who took against the Treaty were hugely divided. Mellows rejected both the Treaty and De Valera’s proposed compromise of external association on the basis that the Republic and the 1919 election was an authentic mandate now held hostage by British propaganda and threats of an invasion: ‘The people are being stampeded, in the people’s minds there is only one alternative to this Treaty and that is terrible, immediate war. That is not the will of the people, that is the fear of the people’. Mellows, together with O’Connor and O’Malley, advocated renewing the struggle against the British, while others, such as Breen and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch, vacillated between this position and the prioritising of army unity. That Frank Aiken, an officer who had fought in Louth and Armagh, initially declared neutral will provide some indication of how differentiated the strategic orientations among the Republicans.</p>
<p>Cumann na mBan was the first Republican organisation to oppose the treaty and one of its members, Constance Markiewicz, spoke during the Treaty debates in terms of the precedent this treaty would establish for national liberation struggles elsewhere, ‘if we pledge ourselves to this thing, whether you call it Empire or Commonwealth, that is treading down the people of Egypt and India’. P.S. O’Hegarty identifies this as the point at which more middle-class elements, such as merchants, cattle dealers and manufacturers, began to take the upper hand within the movement in the name of social stability. They were uninterested in the Republic which had been fought for, but recognised Sinn Féin as as ascendent social force. On the character of this new establishment O’Malley wrote: ‘Socially they had little status. Instead of building their own background, they often tried to ape the mannerisms of the relicts of the garrison, and to develop the ambition to belong to a class which had another social fabric to their own’. Their interests were perfectly compatible with those of the southern unionists, who Griffith met in the course of the debates. Markiewicz asked Griffith on the basis of what democratic mandate he had done so given that southern unionists belonged to a class who had enjoyed the dividends of British imperialism.</p>
<p>In the months before the summer election Collins met with Craig, now head of the regime in the six counties and pledged to end the Belfast boycott in return for assurances that Catholic workers who had been chased from their jobs would be re-instated. Meanwhile Lloyd George established the Ulster Special Constabulary, or B-Specials, a paramilitary colonial police force modelled on Mussolini’s fascisti. Under the dictatorial powers Craig secured in the special powers act the B-Specials were indemnified against prosecution while Sinn Féin, the IRA and Cumann na mBan became proscribed organisations. By mid-1922 there was one armed policeman for every two Catholic families and during the first months of 1922, 171 Catholics were killed.</p>
<p>Though the role of the British in copper-fastening partition and inflicting terror on the Catholics in the six counties has been relatively well-documented, the extent of the involvement of the British in the establishment of the Free State is often understated. Winston Churchill demanded an election be held on the Treaty as soon as possible, but with anti-Treaty sentiment in the army standing at around 63% by Florence O’Donoghue’s estimate, Mulcahy adjourned a decisive convention, at first for one day and then for three months, on the basis that Collins would draft a Free State constitution in the interim period, which was to be Republican in character. The IRB also postponed further discussion on this basis. On 16 March Griffith proclaimed the scheduled army convention. Officers who opposed the treaty such as Oscar Traynor, Sean Russell, Mellows, O’Malley, O’Connor and Lynch formed their own military council, establishing a new headquarters in Parnell Square, aiming to wrest control of the army from the Free State. In an interview given to a newspaper, O’Connor explained that in passing the treaty, the Dáil had effectively abolished itself as it had no mandate to abandon the Republic. The army, which had remained loyal to the Republic declared in 1916, had de facto, become the Republic’s legitimate government. In April they established a garrison in the Four Courts and occupied a number of buildings around Dublin but they remained divided between those who wanted to initiate an attack on the British immediately and those who were more interested in preserving army unity. This latter faction entered into negotiations with Mulcahy and though they had no authority from the Executive to do so, and were denounced by O’Connor and Mellows, no discipline was imposed. Florence O’Donoghue recalls the aimlessness of the debates: ‘It never had a common mind or a common policy. There was not time. Many matters, not strictly the concern of the army, obtruded in discussions, social theories were aired and debated, projects were considered in an atmosphere of unreality, stresses developed which weakened the fabric of authority’. These divisions on strategic orientation and wrangling over the scheduling of conventions worked to the advantage of the Free State which had time to plan for a decisive confrontation once it arose.</p>
<p>Those in favour of the Treaty were far more focused in their aims and in anticipation of an inevitable confrontation began to transfer arms from areas dominated by anti-Treaty army units. While Griffith was more forthright in denouncing Republicans, accusing Erskine Childers of being a British agent, Collins and Mulcahy spoke and acted in more conciliatory terms, allowing representatives of the Republican military council to attend Free State army meetings. Collins also gave the appearance of being more Republican in inclination, organising the assassination of Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial Staff who had personally arranged to keep troops in Dublin, had been involved in the Belfast pogroms as well as well as in organising the B-Specials. Collins also formed an electoral pact with De Valera, which sought to replicate the composition of the second Dáil by offering the electorate a panel of Sinn Féin candidates in identical proportion to the existing Treatyite and anti-Treatyite balance of forces, effectively postponing an electoral decision on the matter. Collins and Griffith were summoned to London a number of times and informed by Churchill and Lloyd George that the pact with the Republicans violated the Treaty, that the withdrawal of British troops would be suspended while it remained in place and began to pressure the Free State government to take decisive action against the Four Courts garrison. That Collins repudiated this pact three days before the election and his promised Republican constitution, published on the day of the election, was subordinate to the Treaty and illegitimate insofar as it contravened it, suggests that he regarded all these overtures to Republican elements within the army as stalling tactics. The pro-Treaty faction of Sinn Féin won 58 seats and the anti-Treaty faction under De Valera took 36. Twelve days after the election the Free State army began to shell the Four Courts with arms obtained from the British. Giving further indication of how detached the Republican’s understanding of the situation was from reality, Mellows cautioned against using too much ammunition against the Free State army as they would need them for the British. Once the Four Courts garrison and the Republican Executive had been dismantled, the Free State had a freer hand to recruit among ex-British soldiers and draw on the support of more overtly anti-Republican elements in Irish society as well as the large pool of unemployed, offering twenty-five shillings per week.</p>
<p>In his memoirs of being imprisoned in Mountjoy during the civil war, the republican socialist Peadar O’Donnell writes about encouraging Mellows’ socialist analysis of the situation, believing that he would distinguish himself as a leader in the future. Though the bulk of the army was ignorant of socialism, and arguably hostile to politics as a point of principle, notes Mellows wrote to O’Malley and Stack from prison identify the men of no property as central to their campaign against the Free State. In The Workers’ Republic, the newspaper of the Communist Party of Ireland, Mellows wrote on the necessity of leading the Labour movement away from commercial and British imperial interests:</p>
<p>‘The Irish Labour Party talked glibly of a Worker’s Republic. It still pretends to have as its objective the establishment of such a state…The existing Irish Republic can be made the Workers’ and Peasants Republic if the labour movement is true to the ideals of James Connolly and true to itself’.</p>
<p>If the Free State was to have been overthrown before it was consolidated as the reactionary and imperial formation it remains today, this would have been the way to do it, but sadly the opportunity for an alliance between anti-imperialists and the working class was quashed due to inadequate leadership and the Free State’s brutality. More typical of the Republican strategy of the time was O’Connor’s reaction to the postal workers’ strike, which was not to support workers’ demands, but rather use the confusion to capture arms of civic guards being brought in as strike breakers. Anti-Treaty volunteers did not make common cause with working class elements establishing Soviets at creameries, but rather threatened to to fire on members of the Transport Union picketing shops in Clonmel that refused to sell butter manufactured by them. Though the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and the Democratic Programme ratified by the first Dáil threaded together anti-imperialism and democratic ownership of the nation’s resources, as the Revolution unfolded it became clear that these were not principled aims of the leadership. O’Malley later regretted not undertaking guerrilla warfare and organising flying columns against the Free State. Establishing a garrison in the Four Courts had been a mistake, given that it was easy to surround, lacked food, had faulty defences and their other forces were concentrated on the wrong side of the widest street in the city.</p>
<p>Harnett attributed the defeat of the Republican side in the civil war to insufficient commitment on behalf of the Republican side; his account of this period is full of instances in which the lives of captured Free State officers were spared and released with money and clothes. The brutality of the Free State’s reprisals, the military courts and Emergency Powers Resolution, granted the state the power to execute prisoners. On a more local level, a definitive turning point was the moving of Free State army men from their local areas where they may be engaging former comrades to to other areas, in order to free up their consciences. The church hierarchy withheld sacraments from Republicans and consistently denounced Republicans from the pulpits even as eighty-one Republicans were executed in 28 rounds between November and May 1923. Mellows, O’Connor, Joe McKelvey and Richard Barrett were also executed and the demoralisation of having such treatment meted out by former comrades, fellow Irishmen and senior IRA officers is a feature of these first-hand accounts.</p>
<p>The legacy of the Free State will not require extensive treatment here. Its administration had much in common with the supposedly overthrown English model. There were some initial attempts at developing indigenous industries, but in overall terms Free State governments have been composed of individuals from comfortable backgrounds who have favoured low taxes, the subsidising of financiers, rentiers and large farmers, suppressing wages and instituting savage cuts to social welfare. The fact that women, such an active constituency during the Revolution in transporting arms, making splints, bandages, clothes and food, nursing, carrying dispatches, scouting, spying, raising funds, arranging billets or undertaking long journeys delivering dispatches at great personal risk vanish from public life for almost half a century, grants a new significance to them being among the most vociferously opposed to the Treaty. The welfare state was farmed out to the church and the Irish language entered into a terminal decline in which it still languishes. The inertia and lack of any significant Republican voice in the present moment corresponds with Mellows’ premonition of a ruling class which would be propped up on the basis of partition:</p>
<p>if this Free State comes into existence, when you will have a permanent government in the country, and permanent governments in any country have a dislike to being turned out, and they will seek to fight their own corner before anything else. Men will get into positions, men will hold power and men who get into positions and hold power will desire to remain undisturbed and will not want to be removed, or will not take a step that will mean removal in the case of failure.</p>
