			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This book emerges from George Saunders’ experience leading a class in Syracuse University on writing the short story form. The texts which have shaped his understanding, as laid out here, are all Russian. Seven stories from Chekhov, Gogol, Tolstoy and Turgenev appear in the edition, followed by a chapter in which Saunders lays out the lessons it offers.</p>
<p>I have never undertaken an MFA programme but I have attended a couple of creative writing classes both in and outside of a university context. The bulk of the information I have sourced on how they function come from articles or books, parts of the syllabi which appear online, reading novels written by, or conversing with people who have completed, been employed on them. One such is Anne Enright who spoke in an interview on the question of whether or not writing can be taught. As a graduate of the prestigious University of East Anglia creative writing programme herself, Enright’s chosen analogy was athletic; when making a throw one can be told how to tuck one’s elbow in. Enright also spoke about her hubris as a young writer, studying under Malcolm Bradbury while at the same time being certain that he had nothing useful to impart to her, a genre of student she has since encountered a number of times since taking her post up. Relationships friends of mine have had with their creative writing lecturers have tended towards the adversarial as their responsibility is often to turn young writers away from their favoured vice — over-writing — which appears to the young writer as a figure of authority trying to domesticate or homogenise those aspects of their style which seem most principled and vital. I have known them to concede, years later, that their lecturers had a point.</p>
<p>I would truly love to construct a dataset of prose produced by a set of authors before and after completing an MFA programme — as well as a control set of texts produced by writers whose applications for entry were rejected — and produce a comprehensive analysis of what MFAs do to writing, but lacking this infrastructure I will outline what I saw happen to a friend’s story, a first draft of which I read eight years ago, and a second when he was two months into an MFA. The story was about a man and his wife or partner in their suburban house. A corpse turns up in the garden and the man dies. I do not intend for this two-sentence summary to create the impression that the characters, setting or plot were underdeveloped, but even if they were this would be beside the point. Four phrases or descriptions have remained in my mind in the years since I read it. It was a perfect object, a mind-to-mind system for the delivery of these four images. Its status as such was typographically and syntactically emphasised; one or two of them had been set apart from the text’s body and appeared in the form of a list.</p>
<p>A year later I read another version that had been through the workshop. The corpse had been accounted for. It became the source of a petty resentment between the man, his wife and the next-door neighbours. There was information pertaining to who knew what about it and the staggered delivery of same was used to up the ante. The images were re-integrated into paragraphs. They remained suggestive but had become functional. The story was no longer a static — and I use this term non-pejoratively — object, it had assumed the shape of the short story as conceived by Saunders, a temporal unfolding, engaging the reader by pulling them forward, sentence by sentence, with non-trivial detail. It had also, as a consequence, been integrated into a ‘chloroformed world’ populated by ‘clockwork cabbages’, to draw on Beckett’s description of Balzac’s novels. According to any honest inventory of the field of play here, rightly so. The number of people who pay thousands of euro with a view to publishing a manuscript with Dalkey Archive must be wholly insignificant in comparison to those looking for guidance on producing a commercially viable work of literary fiction.</p>
<p>Saunders, and I presume anyone useful who teaches creative writing, are not dictating what literature has to be. Each ‘what have we learned here?’ section is followed by Afterthoughts which partially roll back his recommendations in emphasising the importance of informed intuition. I think this is really crucial. Though anyone who has spent a reasonable amount of time reading fiction and has put the hours in at the desk can write a banger paragraph, this cannot be taught. However one can be graded on their ability to sculpt a credible representation of a human being being punished for aspiring to be fully human, experiences a mental event in which they grasp their smallness relative to the universe, or realises how a flaw in their character has led them to commit enormous and harmful errors in their personal or professional lives.</p>
<p>If arguing that naturalism is the dominant generic strain to emerge from the Programme Era would be too generalising we can at least say that it is fundamental to Saunders’. Joe Cleary’s means of differentiating naturalism from realism rests on the position of the reader relative to the writer and the narrator. In naturalistic fiction the reader and the narrator share a sense of superiority over their object of study.</p>
<p>The social predicates which would lead to the emergence of a genre which attempts to conceive of human agency, when everything around you seems to confirm your meaningless, powerlessness and, in the words of Richard Seymour, whether you even are alive are not far for to seek, least of all in Russia, where a disaffected petty-bourgeois intelligentsia found itself caught between absolutism and a rural idiocy bolstered by the orthodox church. We can accommodate British, French and USian naturalism to this model with the addition of a more generalised experience of a squalid and debased urban lifeworld, its dangers and indignities correlating with a growing and brutish working class population.</p>
<p>Naturalism’s high point was towards the end of the nineteenth century. After World War I’s appearance in the chronology and onwards, authors and critics look to a less representative set of writers, who sacralised naturalist detail by locating it relative to symbolic frameworks and / or incarnating it within a high stylistic logic. This was the last historically consequential European literary project before its subordination to the culture industry and American imperial hegemony. Naturalism is therefore the last time literature is intelligible, in the sense that one can qualitatively apprehend a set of guidelines which we can be confident in our ability to convey, in a way that we would not about, for example, Finnegans Wake or a story written by Donald Barthelme.
I got the idea for the short story I am currently writing after reading a hostile review an Irish historian wrote of a collection of research papers. Some of them were written by his peers, others older and more established than him, still more were graduate students. I have a decent hold on the successive interpretative and methodological waves in Irish historiography following the post-revolutionary period, how the war in the north raised the fortunes of a school which emphasised the illegitimacy and sectarianism of the Irish revolutionary tradition, how the Decade of Centenaries has given a larger public profile to feminist critiques of the Saorstát dispensation and the ways in which Sinn Féin’s electoral ascendency in both of the island’s statelets has rendered a post-political perspective focusing on ‘shared history’ or Irish complicity in Empire seem more embattled than in previous years.</p>
<p>From Saunders’ point of view, a set of petty and interpersonal feuds, character sketches of the eclectic set of people one gets in academia, imbued with that specific oddness that derives from being extreme in one’s interest in a particular subject, give us some of the raw materials, but we are still looking for an engine. One way Saunders proposes of getting yourself out of a rut of this type is to write the sentence ‘and then something happened which changed everyone forever’ then figure out what justifies it. What would this be here? The occasion of the review ruining a scholar’s career? The protagonist reflecting on the promise of the empty page feeling at the end that he has betrayed himself and his chosen field? How would one use Saunders’ book to write a story about thought?</p>
<p>This is an important question. One of the most notable features of these programmes is that their defining critical mode is appreciative. It strikes against every theoretical development in literature departments over the past century, which have been, for better and for worse, characterised by a subsumption to vibes-based sociology. An attention to plot, craft, character and language should not be left to those who are seeking to understand literature in order to write it.</p>
<p>Pulling on the strengths both of historical grounding and informed intuition (to leave the issue of the destruction of humanities departments in general to one side) seems particularly urgent since Saunders manifests the aesthete’s lack of interest in social life. He refers to one character’s critique of feudalism as ‘emotional Bolshevism’, uses the word ‘bourgeoisie’ in places where he should be using the word ‘bourgeois’ and cites Alexander Solzhenitsyn to the effect that Stalin lowered people into vats of acid.</p>
<p>So, worth reading, but should have included excerpts from Lenin’s book on the development of Russian capitalism.</p>

<p><em>Chapter One: Commodities</em></p>
<p><strong>The Two Factors of the Commodity</strong></p>
<p><em>125</em> The capitalist economy consists of commodities. A commodity is an object of consumption or of production. It satisfies a need and this need is referred to as the commodity’s use-value.</p>
<p><em>[126 Footnote cites Locke ‘The natural worth of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities, or serve the conveniences of human life’]</em></p>
<p><em>[Funny sidebar: ‘In English writers of the seventeenth century we still often find the word ‘worth’ used for use-value and ‘value’ for exchange value. This is quite in accordance with the spirit of a language that likes to use a Teutonic word for the actual thing, and a Romance word for its reflection’.]</em></p>
<p>Where these needs arise from is a broader social question but use-value is also in the physical thing itself; it has a real existence and the use is realised in the commodity’s consumption whereas the <em>thing</em>-ness of the commodity is the bearer of its exchange-value.</p>
<p><em>[Footnote: ‘In bourgeois society the legal fiction prevails that each person, as a buyer, has an encyclopedic knowledge of commodities’.]</em></p>
<p><em>127</em> Exchange-value renders a commodity commensurate, makes it possible to compare and conflate it with other things and have it move around in exchange for those things. So a given commodity, e.g. wheat ‘has many exchange values instead of one’. So we might say 1 corn = x iron and x wool and x coal etc.</p>
<p>This exchange value is an abstraction. It expresses use value at a level beyond the mere commodity itself.</p>
<p><em>128</em> Use value is qualitative, it works at the point of consumption. If you’re hungry, cheese will do you while steel won’t.</p>
<p>Exchange value is quantitative; if you’re hungry and you have steel you could exchange it for cheese, but these two functions are distinct. You can’t eat an exchange value or hammer it into a car.</p>
<p>In order to understand exchange value it is necessary to ignore its physical, tangible and sensuous aspects. From an exchange perspective it is not important if something is a table or a piece of yarn.</p>
<p><em>129</em> And as this value is quantitative, the decisive unit is the amount of labour it contains which is measured in duration, hours, day, etc.</p>
<p>This does not mean that if a labourer takes six months to make a single shirt that shirt is worth millions, because while it is a quantitative measurement its also an abstract one; all human labour consists of a single homogenous mass which forms a socially average unit of necessary labour power on average.</p>
<p>This equilibrium which is called socially necessary labour-time and it is the labour time required to produce any use-value under conditions of production normal for a given society, i.e. with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour regnant within it.</p>
<p>For example, the introduction of power-looms in England reduced the labour time required to convert a given quantity of yarn into woven fabric. It did not make the labour process itself shorter, but the product of an individual hour of labour now represented half an hour of social labour, and fell to one half its former value.</p>
<p><em>[Footnote in which Marx finds his theory anticipated in a document on Money written in the 1730’s]</em></p>
<p><em>130</em> The value of a commodity would remain static if the labour-time required for production remained static. But this changes with every variation in the productivity of labour, which is altered by advances in technology and machinery as well as:</p>
<ol>
<li>the worker’s average degree of skill</li>
<li>the social organisation of the producers of production</li>
<li>the extent and effectiveness of the means of production</li>
<li>conditions found in the natural environment (e.g. the same quantity of labour is present in eight bushels of corn in favourable seasons and only four in unfavourable seasons and the same quantity of labour provides more metal in rich mines than in poor.)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>131</em> The more productive labour is the less labour-time is required to produce an article, the less labour is crystallised in that article and the lower its value.</p>
<p>The value of a commodity therefore varies as the quantity and, counter-intuitively, the productivity of the labour which finds its realisation within the commodity.</p>
<p>A thing can be a use-value without being a value, i.e. directly obtained without mediation through exchange, e.g. the peasant who grows crops which are directly consumed by himself or his feudal lord.</p>
<p>The corn received as rent-in-kind does not become a commodity just because it is produced for others. In order to become a commodity the product must be transferred to the other person, for whom it serves as a use-value, through exchange.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities</strong></p>
<p><em>132</em> In a society based on commodity production, labour is necessarily divided.</p>
<p><em>133</em> Before commodity production became dominant labour was a condition of human existence; clothes were made in antiquity, farming was divided in pre-historical agriculture.</p>
<p><em>137</em> There is a difference between concrete and abstract labour; the former pertains to use value, the second to exchange.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Value Form, or Exchange-Value</strong></p>
<p><em>138</em> Commodities have both concrete and abstract traits. Cheese has hunger-satisfying aspects, steel is durable, but what links them together and renders them commensurate is their containing labour-power.</p>
<p><em>142</em> Labour-power is not value in itself, it only becomes value once it is concretised in an objective form.</p>
<p><em>145</em> As before this commensurability varies: the labour-time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every influence in the productivity of the weaver or the tailor.</p>
<p><em>147 - 8</em> As an equivalent <em>Commodity A</em> (the linen) imposes on <em>Commodity B</em> (the coat) a form of value particular to it. The linen brings into view its own existence as a value in the fact that it can be assumed as a form of value separate from its own physical being.</p>
<p>This commensurability makes it possible to compare the concrete or private labour in the linen with the abstract or social labour embodied in the coat.</p>
<p>In this way the commodity’s value is no longer qualitative but becomes relative, because a commodity can never express the magnitude of its own value. It needs that reflection in the form of a <em>Commodity B</em>.</p>
<p><em>149</em> Value is therefore social, it’s not something that can be measured independently. We cannot understand the amount of value in a single tyre or cheese-wheel independently of the broader social productive process.</p>
<p><em>151</em> Section about how Aristotle could not think his way past market relations without this concept of value, so he couldn’t see that what every pair of commodities have in common is abstract labour.</p>
<p><em>153</em> Examples of two schools of orthodox economists who only grapple with one side of value, whether quantitative or qualitative, and miss the dual character of the phenomenon as a result.</p>
<p><em>156</em> The relative value of each commodity is an endless series of expressions of value which are all different from the relative form of value of every other commodity.</p>
<p><em>162</em> The general form of value then gives way to the money form.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secret</strong></p>
<p><em>167</em> This next step from value to money is a necessary extension because producers do not come into contact with one another on the market through barter, their purchases are mediated through the market.</p>
<p><em>168</em> A fully-fledged market of commodity production develops over a long time-frame.</p>
<p><em>169</em> Its operations and relations are obscured or reified, which finds its expression in the incorrect and self-serving assertions put forward by orthodox political economists.</p>
<p><em>[175 footnote: ‘the vulgar economists confine themselves to systematising in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlasting truths, the banal and complacent notions held by the bourgeois agents of production about their own world, which is to them the best possible one’, and he calls a few of these economists dwarfs and asses.]</em></p>
<p><em>170</em> Uses feudalism and the story of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (a 1719 novel written by Daniel Defoe about a man who washes up on an island off the coast of Venezuela and establishes a ‘self-sufficient society’) to describe moments, both historical or imagined, in which the trajectory of commodities, outputs of labour and / or agriculture are clear, as it appears as personal relations and not social relations between things.</p>
<p><em>171</em> Reference to what a communist society would look like:</p>
<p><em>‘Let us finally imagine…an association of free men, working with the means of production held in common, and expending their many different forms of labour-power in full self-awareness as one single social labour force’.</em></p>
<p><em>172 - 176</em> Class series of riffs on political economy and Christianity.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 2: The Process of Exchange</em></p>
<p><em>178 - 9</em> Commodities cannot circulate by themselves, their buyers and sellers must encounter one another in the market as &lsquo;personifications of economic relations&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the seller, a commodity has no use-value, for the buyer it does. This changing of hands constitutes exchange.</p>
<p><em>181</em> Money arises out of these requirements and further entrenches the separation between use-value and value.</p>
<p><em>182 - 3</em> Brief account of the historical roots of money, how it first arises among nomadic peoples because their possessions are mobile and their form of life brings them into contact with other communities, encouraging the exchange of products.</p>
<p><em>183</em> In order to better service the needs of circulation in a modern society, the money-form assumes the shape of precious metals as these are the commodities best fitted to &lsquo;perform the social function of a universal equivalent.</p>
<p><em>184</em> firstly because their &rsquo;every sample possesses the same uniform quantity&rsquo; and secondly because they are divisible.</p>
<p><em>185</em> Just because precious metals represent a symbol of value does not mean that they are unreal; they give witness to an actual social relationship, namely a series of exchanges which necessitate a common unit.</p>
<p>As with commodities, precious metals exist on both the concrete and abstract levels: &rsquo;every commodity is a symbol, since, as value, it is only the material shell of the human labour expended on it&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>186</em> Money is also similar to the commodity in the sense that its value can only be expressed in other forms of itself. This value is determined &lsquo;by the labour-time required for its production&hellip;expressed in the quantity of any other commodity in which the same amount of labour-time is congealed&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>187</em> Once money has become a universal equivalent, human activity becomes increasingly atomised: &lsquo;Their own relations of production&hellip;assume a material shape which is independent of their control and their conscious individual action&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 3: Money, or the Circulation of Commodities</em></p>
<p><strong>1. The Measure of Values</strong></p>
<p><em>188</em> It is not just money that renders commodities commensurate, they already are commensurate by virtue of having human labour in common.</p>
<p><em>189</em> But money does grant this equation of commodities a socially valid character, there is no longer any need for the 1 iron = 5 wheat because of money.</p>
<p><em>191</em> Gold then becomes a universal measurement.</p>
<p><em>193</em> The price of money and the price of commodities are independent; one may rise and one may fall, both may rise or fall together.</p>
<p>The terms originally assigned to specific amounts of precious metals (a &lsquo;pound&rsquo; initially referred to a pound of silver) become autonomous over time because:</p>
<ol>
<li>the introduction of foreign coinage which develop different names</li>
<li>the development of material wealth; copper edging out silver, edged out in turn by gold</li>
<li>successive waves of de-valuation</li>
</ol>
<p><em>194</em> In this way the nature of money has been reified beyond its actual function, a confusion that is assisted by the fact that they at once real and unreal.</p>
<p><em>[One enduring controversy of Marxist economics and / or Marxology is known as the transformation problem, namely whether or not Marx provides us with a comprehensive account of how the abstract value of the commodity becomes a concrete price in a competitive marketplace. There are a number of comments in this chapter which pertain to this question so they will be signalled from this point on]</em></p>
<p><em>196</em> <em>[Material on the Transformation Problem]</em></p>
<p>The magnitude of a commodity&rsquo;s value expresses the socially average labour-time required to produce it. When this commodity&rsquo;s value is realised in its sale this appears as the exchange-ratio between a single commodity and the money-commodity.</p>
<p>This relation may express the magnitude of value and the greater or lesser quantity of money it can be sold for according to a particular set of circumstances. Therefore there is the possibility that there will be a disproportion between these two; this asymmetry is fundamental to the price-form.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;This is not a defect, but, on the contrary, it makes this form the adequate one for a mode of production whose laws can only assert themselves as blindly operating averages between constant irregularities&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>197</em> Price might cease to express value altogether; one could sell courage or honour, things which command a price without value, but it might also conceal a real value-relation.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Means of Circulation</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) The Metamorphosis of Commodities</strong></p>
<p><em>198</em> Great image regarding the nature of contradiction</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;it is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another and at the same time constantly flying away from it. The ellipse is a form of motion within which this contradiction is both realised and resolved&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>This is the social metabolism in the mode of production known as capitalism.</p>
<p><em>200</em> We are given a simple, two-stage equation to express the process of exchange:</p>
<p>Commodity -&gt; Money -&gt; Commodity or CMC</p>
<p>The first stage, commodity to money, is the decisive moment, this decides whether or not a commodity can command a price.</p>
<p><em>201 - 3</em> In order for a commodity to command a price, it must have a use-value for the purchaser.</p>
<p><em>Material on the Transformation Problem</em></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;We leave out of consideration here any possible subjective errors in calculation by the owner of the commodity, which will immediately be corrected objectively in the market. We suppose him to have spent only the average socially necessary quantity of labour time. The price of the commodity&hellip;is merely the money-name of the quantity of social labour objectified in it&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>The articulation of this metamorphosis is not straightforward it takes place in haphazard and spontaneous ways across the market, the sellers:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;find out that the same division of labour which turns them into private producers also makes the social process of production and the relations of the individual producers to each other&hellip;independent of the producers themselves&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;The realisation of a commodity&rsquo;s price, or of its merely ideal value-form, is therefore at the same time, and inversely, the realisation of the merely ideal use-value of money; the conversion of a commodity into money is the conversion of money into a commodity&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>Every purchase is a sale, every sale a purchase, C -&gt; M is also at once M -&gt; C from the point of view of the buyer.</p>
<p><em>208</em> But this does not mean equilibrium is achieved. Every sale might well be a purchase, but they constitute two separate acts between two people in opposition to one another.</p>
<p><em>209</em> The independence of buyers and sellers may also assert themselves; this is what happens in a crisis within a capitalist economy.</p>
<p><strong>(b) The Circulation of Money</strong></p>
<p><em>213</em> As money and commodities always come into physical confrontation with each other, the amount of money that is required to facilitate their movement in exchange is equal to the sum of all prices. Since prices rise and fall, the amount of money required to move commodities around may also rise or fall.</p>
<p><em>214</em> One commodity infects another through their common value-relation, so their prices gradually settle down into proportions determined by their comparative values until the values of all commodities are estimated in terms of the new value of the monetary metal.</p>
<p><em>216</em> A decisive factor in this regard is the question of turnover:</p>
<p>the quantity of money functioning as the circulating medium = the sum of prices / divided the number of times coins of the same denomination turn over</p>
<p>The measure of how often a coin turns over is known as its velocity.</p>
<p>Velocity differs significantly according to context, place, time, level of social development etc.</p>
<p>If there are less turnovers, less coin is necessary and vice versa.</p>
<p><em>217</em> These dynamics also might provoke the system into crisis as they are non-simultaneous. As before, orthodox economists ascribe this to insufficient money in the system.</p>
<p><em>[218 Footnote: this is not to suggest that insufficient money in the system is not one of the causes of some crises, but it is only one reason among others and often serves the purpose of excluding more long-run dynamics from consideration.]</em></p>
<p><strong>(c) Coin. The Symbol of Value</strong></p>
<p><em>221</em> In sum, average value commands average price.</p>
<p><em>222 - 3</em> History of the use of precious metals as money, the role of the state in minting them.</p>
<p><em>224</em> Introduction of credit and paper money into the argument.</p>
<p><em>225</em> Only insofar as paper money represents gold does it have value.</p>
<p><strong>3. Money</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) Hoarding</strong></p>
<p><em>227</em> As money becomes that universal repository of value, the urge develops to retain a hold over it, as it is an index of social power.</p>
<p><em>229 - 230</em> Various quotes from classical sources about the dangers of money as tending towards the destruction of previously existing social relations.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Means of Payment</strong></p>
<p><em>235</em> As purchase and sale are non-identical, certain forms of monetary infrastructure develop between buyers, sellers, debtors and borrowers to offset their debts. This reduces the amount of actual money moving around as money is functioning only nominally on balance sheets.</p>
<p><em>236</em> This is what brings markets flooded with credit into crisis every few years; a sudden realisation that there&rsquo;s no money behind this movement of assets.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital</strong></p>
<p><em>247</em> The circulation of commodities as the starting-point of capital.</p>
<p>[Origin of capitalism]</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;The production of commodities and their circulation in its developed form, namely trade, form the historic presuppositions under which capital arises. World trade and the world market date from the sixteenth century, and from then on the modern history of capital starts to unfold&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>Money is the first form of capital.</p>
<p>The first distinction between money and capital is the simple distinction between the difference in their form of circulation in C-M-C and re-conversion of money into commodities - selling in order to buy.</p>
<p><em>248</em> The movement of M-C-M passes through two antithetical phases.</p>
<p>The first phase = M-C (the purchase): Money is changed into a commodity.</p>
<p>The second phase = C-M (the sale): Commodity is changed back again into money.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;These two phases, conceived of in a unity, constitute the total movement which exchanges money for a commodity, and the same commodity for money, which buys a commodity in order to sell it.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>At root here is the exchange of money for money, M-M.</p>
<p><em>249</em> In C-M-C, money is at the end converted into a commodity that serves as a use-value, it has been spent once and for all.</p>
<p>In this phase, the same piece of money is displaced twice; the seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to another seller.</p>
<p>In M-C-M, the buyer lays out money so that he can get money back. The money is not spent, it is only advanced.</p>
<p>Here, it is not the money that moves twice but the commodity; the twofold displacement of the same piece of money causes the money to flow back to its original point of departure.</p>
<p><em>252</em> It is also possible that in C-M-C, the two extremes may represent quantitatively different magnitudes of value. The peasant may sell his corn at higher than its original value or more, he may be cheated by the clothes merchant, but these differences are accidents, they don&rsquo;t change the substance of what is happening.</p>
<p>When selling in order to buy, we aim at satisfying one&rsquo;s needs via consumption.</p>
<p>When buying in order to sell our end and our beginning are the same: €100 -&gt; €110, capital M -&gt; M&rsquo;, this increase in capital becomes an end in itself.</p>
<p><em>253</em> Aristotle described how trade was barter but as trade developed further money became necessary as the lubricant to facilitate transactions on a broader scale.</p>
<p>This creates a field separable from economics; chrematistics, which revolves around money as a beginning and end, and these, for Aristotle, are often confused, reflecting the stage of economic and social development his society had reached at the time.</p>
<p><em>254</em> The conscious bearer of this movement is a capitalist. He is the person from whom money departs and to whom it returns. Use-value is unimportant for him, his immediate aim is profit, and not just profit on a single transaction, but a continuous and unceasing movement at profit-making.</p>
<p><em>255</em> Money is both independent, becoming itself in abolishing itself, but is also the active subject.</p>
<p><em>256</em> This is a situation that does not just apply to merchant capital or trade but also to industrial capital, which operates according to the same logic.</p>
<p><em>257</em> M-C-M&rsquo; is the general form of capital.</p>

<p>[On the issue of whether or not value is formed in circulation: Important to note that he prefaces this with making clear that this is an abstract example]</p>
<p><em>260</em> What is happening here is a change in form, the value remains constant as the same quantity of social labour remains in the hand of the commodity-owner, in the form of the commodity or in the form of money; it is not an increase in value.</p>
<p><em>261 - 2</em> Some of the mistakes bourgeois economists make in taking circulation for value creation.</p>
<p><em>262</em> <em>&lsquo;It is plain that no one abstracts more value from circulation than he throws into it&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>263</em> The formation of surplus value has nothing to do with whether a commodity was sold above its value or not.</p>
<p>[The transformation problem]</p>
<p><em>269 &lsquo;If prices actually differ from values, we must first reduce the former to the latter, i.e. disregard this situation as an accidental one in order to observe the phenomenon of the formation of capital on the basis of the exchange of commodities in its purity, and to prevent our observations from being interfered with by disturbing incidental circumstances which are irrelevant to the actual course of the process&hellip;The continual oscillations in prices, their rise and fall, compensate each other, cancel each other out, and carry out their own reduction to an average price which is their internal regulator&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>Chapter 6: The Sale and Purchase of Labour Power</em></p>
<p><em>270</em> Labour as a source of value.</p>
<p><em>271</em> In order for the commodity owner to increase the value of the commodities in their possession they must find, on the market, a person willing to sell their own labour capacity. They enter into relations with each other as equals in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p>The seller of labour power sells their labour for a limited period, rather than all in one go, as this would make them a slave, &lsquo;from an owner of a commodity into a commodity&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>272 - 3</em> The owner of labour power must also have no other commodity for sale&hellip;&lsquo;he is rid of them, he is free of all the objects needed for the realisation of his labour-power&rsquo;.</p>
<p>[Historical transition to capitalism]</p>
<p><em>274</em> _&lsquo;money, as we have seen, exists prior to the existence of capitalism proper, but commodity circulation is, at this time, limited in terms of how far it can develop&rsquo;. _</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;The historical conditions of its existence [capital] are by no means given with the mere circulation of money and commodities. It arises only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence finds the free worker available, on the market, as the seller of his own labour power. And this one historical pre-condition comprises a world&rsquo;s history&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>The labour-time necessary for the production of a commodity determines the value of labour-power, it represents no more than a definite quantity of the average social labour embodied within it.</p>
<p><em>276 - 7</em> Wages, in additional to historical and moral elements [E.P. Thompson writes on this], are determined by how much it costs for the worker to reproduce their own conditions of existence.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7: The Labour Process and the Valorisation Process</strong></p>
<p><em>1. The Labour Process</em></p>
<p><em>283</em> Marx begins the chpater by considering labour outside of any specific social or historical formation, as process by man through his own actions, mediates regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and nature.</p>
<p><em>284</em> This activity is specific to man. This is not to say that animals don&rsquo;t work, but man is unique in that man envisions what he does or make ideally before he does so.</p>
<p>Difference between raw materials and the &lsquo;free gifts of nature&rsquo;:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;All those things which labour merely separates from immediate connection with their environment are objects of labour spontaneously provided by nature, such as fish caught and separated from their natural element, namely water, timber felled in virgin forests, and ores extracted from their veins. If, on the other hand, the object of labour has, so to speak, been filtered through previous labours, we call it raw material&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>285</em> As such, activities such as e.g.agriculture requires a relatively significant amount of social development</p>
<p><em>286</em> Man is therefore a tool-making animal. Instruments of labour from antiquity are the fossil record of human civilisation, it is not what is made by how, and in what way that distinguishes distinct economic epochs.</p>
<p><em>287</em> Use-value is created by adapting natural material to human need. This is done by labour being induced into the object. What appeared from the worker&rsquo;s point of view as exertion or &lsquo;unrest&rsquo; is now a fixed, objective characteristic in an object.</p>
<p>Use-values created in previous exertions of labour also enter into the labour process in creating of a new object; products can be the output of labour as well as the inputs.</p>
<p><em>288</em> These products may form a crucial part of the resultant commodity, such as lead going into solder or they may be only accessories such as oil being used to light the factory.</p>
<p><em>289</em> In encountering these objects the living labour power of the worker awakens the dead labour in these objects from the dead into real and effective use-value.</p>
<p><em>290</em> The use living labour puts them to is a form of consumption known as &lsquo;productive consumption&rsquo;. This is distinct from individual consumption in that it is not a using up of products for subsistence purposes while productive consumption aims at the production of use values, &rsquo;the everlasting nature-imposed condition of human existence&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>291</em> As the capitalist purchases labour power through the workers&rsquo; wages he owns the labour-power as a commodity, and deploys it as he sees fit; i.e. its application to the dead labour of other products he owns, to imbue their dead labour with living labour to preserve their use-values for sale.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Valorisation Process</strong></p>
<p><em>294</em> The preservation of use-values can require labour-power to be imbued in a product at a number of different places and times, picking the cotton and spinning the yarn can all be considered as different stages in the same labour process.</p>
<p><em>296</em> In the course of a given labour process, a specific quantity of labour has entered the resultant commodity, but only socially necessary labour time counts towards this value&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p><em>298</em> Presents an example whereby the capitalist might recoup no profit.</p>
<p><em>300</em> The use-value of labour and the wages extended in order to recoup that use-value are non-identical.</p>
<p><em>301</em> Account of how surplus value is transformed into capital.</p>
<p><em>302</em> If the process of recouping surplus value proceeds, it is part of the process of valorisation.</p>

<p><em>305</em> The concrete labour performed will become abstract.</p>
<p><em>[Footnote on skilled versus unskilled labour; argues skilled labour is a kink that will be steadily transformed into unskilled labour over time.]</em></p>
<p><em>Chapter 8: Constant Capital and Variable Capital</em></p>
<p><em>307</em> Summary of the previous chapter.</p>
<p>It is not the case that the worker labours to create new value on the one hand and produces value on the other; labour is twofold and both of these processes occur simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>309</em> Presents an example whereby a machine is developed that allows a spinner to become six times more effective and to spin as much cotton in 6 hours as he formerly accomplished in 36. This 36lbs of cotton absorbs the same amount of labour as the 6lbs did formerly, but the value added by the labour of the spinner to each pound of raw material is a sixth of what it was before.</p>
<p>It is possible for the exchange value of the cotton to fluctuate if this technological innovation is introduced unevenly across the market; if a capitalist has a stockpile of cotton, they will find that the exchange value of his cotton has decreased by ~85%.</p>
<p><em>310</em> While the addition of new value and the reviving of old value are different processes, they are added in proportion to one another.</p>
<p><em>311</em> Means of production transfer new value to the commodity but only insofar as they lose their use and exchange value:</p>
<p><em>312</em> they cannot transfer more value than they lose during the process by the destruction of their own use-value.</p>
<p>If a machine is worth €10,000 and wears out in 10,000 days it transfers one-thousandth of its value every day. The machine continues to take part in the labour process throughout this period but in a way that it is increasingly diminished.</p>
<p>_&lsquo;Thus it appears that one factor of the labour process, a means of production, continually enters as a whole into that process, while it only enters in parts into the valourisation process&rsquo;. _</p>
<p><em>317</em> Surplus value produces value over and above the value contained in the materials productively consumed in the course of the labour process.</p>
<p>Capital deployed in the labour process splits into two parts; constant and variable capital.</p>
<p>Constant capital, or <em>C</em>, refers to capital turned into means of production; raw material, auxiliary material and instruments of labour which do not undergo any quantitative alteration in the productive process.</p>
<p>Variable capital, or <em>v</em>, is capital which does undergo a quantitative alteration of value. It reproduces the equivalent of its own value, is transformed into labour and produces an excess or surplus which varies in turn according to circumstances.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus Value</em></p>
<p><strong>1. The Degree of Exploitation of Labour Power</strong></p>
<p><em>322</em> Proof that an increase in value is due to <em>v</em>, which sets <em>C</em> = 0.</p>
<p><em>323</em> The precise concrete form that constant capital assumes is irrelevant, all that matters is that it absorbs labour expended in production.</p>
<p><em>324</em> If we subtract new value produced from the total expended on the labour process we are left with the amount of surplus value and from these two figures we can calculate the rate of profit or &rsquo;the relative magnitude of the surplus value&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>327</em> This rate of exploitation expresses how much of the working day is composed of socially necessary labour time.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 10: The Working Day</em></p>
<p><strong>The Limits of the Working Day</strong></p>
<p><em>341</em> The precise length of the working day varies; it does not always align with the exact number of hours a worker requires in order to reproduce their own conditions of existence; its total length varies with the duration of surplus labour expended.</p>
<p>It does however have hard limits, whether physical, mental or social, and these all vary according place, time, social, cultural development etc.</p>
<p><em>342</em> The working day is therefore a crucial site of struggle: the capitalist has extended variable capital in the form of wages in order to assert their control over the workers&rsquo; labour-power with a view to extracting a surplus over and above what he has paid for. (This is why the then-contemporary reformist notion of extracting a &lsquo;just price&rsquo; for one&rsquo;s work is a nonsense)</p>
<p><em>2. The Voracious Appetite for Surplus Labour. Manufacturer and Boyar</em></p>
<p>[Transition to Capitalism]</p>
<p><em>344</em> Surplus value pre-dates capitalism and can be found at any point in history in which a particular section of society enjoys a monopoly over the means of production, whether plantations in the southern United States or Norman baronies. In this situation workers will always be compelled to expend some of their own labour in order to extract their own sustenance.</p>
<p><em>345</em> However production for the sake of use-value as under feudalism introduces hard limits to surplus value extraction, there will be no accumulation of surplus value as an end in itself, at least until money becomes generalised as a universal equivalent.</p>
<p>[Slavery]</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;as soon as peoples whose production still moves within the lower forms of slave-labour&hellip;are drawn into a world market dominated by the capitalist mode of production, whereby the sale of their products for export develops into their principal interest, the civilised horrors of over-work are grafted onto the barbaric horrors of slavery, serfdom etc. Hence he Negro labour in the southern states of the American Union preserved a moderately patriarchal character as long as production as directed to the satisfaction of immediately local requirements. But in proportion as the export of cotton became of vital interest to consumption of his life in seven years of labour, became a  factor in a calculated and calculating system. It was no longer a question of obtaining from him a certain quantity of useful products, but rather of the production of the surplus-value itself&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>346</em> As the labourer works simultaneously for the capitalist (creating surplus value) and for his wages (reproducing his own conditions of existence) exploitation is not directly visible as it was under feudalism, when toil would be conducted on the lord&rsquo;s field separate from his own holdings.</p>
<p><em>348</em> The English Factory Acts had the effect of imposing restrictions on the capitalist&rsquo;s ability to recoup surplus from the labourer; this was won in the course of struggle and also because it is sometimes necessary for the bourgeois state to step in and mediate between capital and labour.</p>

<p><strong>4. Day-Work and Night-Work. The Shift System</strong></p>
<p><em>367</em> Constant capital has to be absorbing labour power constantly; its lying fallow represents a loss for the capitalist and this is why the extension of the working day beyond its natural limits is in the capitalist&rsquo;s interests. Shift work or night-work are two potential solutions since it is impossible for the capitalist to exploit the same workers for an entire day.</p>

<p><em>Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus Value</em></p>
<p><em>430</em> Relative surplus value can be inceased by shortening the amount of labour time which is socially necessary to produce a particular commodity.</p>
<p><em>432</em> As the reduction of socially necessary labour time is a consequence of the increase of surplus value the labour process is constantly revolutionised.</p>
<p>The increased surplus value re-couped from lengthening the working day is increased absolute surplus value.</p>
<p>The cheapening of a commodity by raising productivity in the sector in which it is produced resonates along the supply chain; a raising of the productivity in the production of thread will make shoes and clothes cheaper.</p>
<p>As the raising of productivity will shorten the amount of necessary labour time required to produce a commodity, larger portion of the working day is expended on the production of surplus value, which means the capitalist can sell the commodity at a price higher than the social price.</p>
<p><em>433</em> This the mechanism behind market competition.</p>
<p><em>436</em> Once the capitalists introduce the same innovation the advantage vanishes and the social price catches up.</p>
<p><em>437</em> The absolute value of a commodity is irrelevant to the capitalist: only the surplus is important.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 13: Co-operation</em></p>
<p><em>439</em> One of the conditions most important for the development of manufacture is the concentration of workers in one place.</p>
<p>It can be seen in the handicraft trades, with the primary difference between it and production under the guilds (presumably) is the number of people involved in the assembly of a particular commodity.</p>
<p><em>440</em> When a certain minimum of workers are concentrated in one place individual differences or deviations of productivity reach an equilibrium and average each other out.</p>
<p><em>441</em> This can only happen when a number of workers are employed by the same capitalist; this equalisation can occur when twelve workers toil for the same boss, but not if these twelve workers were toiling for six different bosses.</p>
<p>If one of these workers took significantly longer than the average socially necessary labour time to produce a commodity his labour would not count as average labour, it would be unsaleable or saleable only at less than the average value.</p>
<p><em>442</em> Concentration also secures economy in the mans of production, a smaller part of their value is distributed to each product.</p>
<p><em>448</em> Co-operation requires significant capital outlay in order to get started.</p>
<p>Which means it requires the productive forces to have reached a particular level.</p>
<p><em>449</em> Concentration and co-operation also clarifies the antagonism that exists between capital and labour.</p>
<p><em>450</em> The despotism integral to the capital / labour relationship assumes new forms, a new caste of foremen, supervisors and overseers develop.</p>

<p><em>452</em> Pre-capitalist forms of co-operation are characterised by common ownership over the means of production and tribal or communitarian social forms in general. Co-operation in the middle ages and colonial settlements have depended on coercion, enslavement.</p>
<p><em>453</em> From the peasant and the artisan&rsquo;s perspective, co-operation is a novel invention of capitalist production.</p>
<p>The productive power of capitalism is the productive power of concentrated labour, not the productive power of capital.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 14: The Division of Labour and Manufacture</em></p>
<p><strong>The Dual Origin of Manufacture</strong></p>
<p><em>455</em> The period Marx argues is characterised by manufacture extends from the middle of the sixteenth century to the last third of the eighteenth.</p>
<p>Its origin can be located firstly in the assembly of workers in a single workshop under a single capitalist, bringing together and rationalising a work process previously conducted by a number of individually employed handicraftsmen, e.g. tailors, locksmiths, glaziers, painters, gilders etc.</p>
<p><em>456</em> It may also happen by retaining these individual roles within a single premises; over time these individual roles manifest themselves as a division of labour.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Specialised Worker and His Tools</strong></p>
<p><em>458</em> This increases productivity.</p>
<p><em>470</em> In every craft it takes control of manufacture creates a class of &lsquo;so-called unskilled labourers, a class strictly excluded by the nature of the handicraft industry&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Manufacture develops a specialty towards the standardisation or perfection of efficient production it does so at the expense of the workers&rsquo; all-round human development (in a technical rather than spiritual sense).</p>
<p>For the unskilled labourer, the cost of apprenticeship vanishes, for the skilled labourer it falls.</p>
<p>One exception to this rule comes in instances where the development of the labour process throws up new and unforseen practices which did not exist in handicraft.</p>

<p><em>476</em> The division of labour within the workshop depends on the despotic power the capitalist wields over their own premises.</p>
<p>The division of labour within society depends on the dispersal of means of production among many independent producers.</p>

<p><em>Chapter 15: Machinery and Large-Scale Industry</em></p>
<p><strong>1. The Development of Machinery</strong></p>
<p><em>492</em> Under capitalism machinery does not reduce the difficulty of labour; its function is to cheapen commodities by reducing the amount of necessary labour time.</p>
<p><em>494</em> A machine consists of three parts:</p>
<p>i) the motor mechanism, such as a steam or electro-magnetic engine, which drives the machine as a whole
ii) the transmitting mechanism, such as shafts, pulleys, straps or ropes, which regulate the motion and changes its form when necessary
iii) the tool or working machine, which is the same apparatus or tool as a handicraftsman or manufacturing worker might use.</p>
<p><em>495</em> Some machines are a merely slightly altered version of old handicraft tools such as the power-loom, they may also be completely unaltered, such as knives in a chopping machine.</p>
<p>The same operations are being performed as in manufacture, but the machine has taken the place of a mere implement. In this way the number of tools which can be brought into play is independent of the organic limitations of the handicraftsman, who can only use as many tools as he or she can manipulate with their hands, limbs, etc.</p>
<p><em>496</em> It is the first component, the motor mechanism that underwent the most significant transformation in the course of the industrial revolution.</p>
<p><em>497</em> Motors did not bring the industrial revolution about in and of themselves; the steam-engine was invented towards the end of the seventeenth century. Their invention rather made a revolution necessary as an increase in machine size required more power.</p>
<p><em>504</em> As demand for machines increased and the machine-making industry developed the division of labour deepens tending towards the abolition of the handicraft and manufacturing systems.</p>
<p>In this way industry overthrows its foundation once it attains to a specific level of development as the machine&rsquo;s productive capacity is no longer constrained by the limits of personal strength and skill.</p>
<p><em>513</em> Whenever it costs as much labour to produce a machine as is saved by the employment of that machine, all that has taken place is a movement of labour from one place to another; the total labour required to produce a commodity has not been reduced, the productivity of labour has not been increased.</p>
<p><em>515 - 7</em> Proof that the labour objectified in the machine is much lower in quantity than the living labour it replaces.</p>
<p>Whether or not the capitalist will adopt a particular machine is therefore determined by the difference between the value of the machine and the value of the labour-power replaced by it; cheaper labour is the only reason a capitalist will use a machine.</p>
<p>This is because the capitalist is making money from exploiting surplus labour, not through savings obtained through mechanisation; the machine does not produce value.</p>
<p>In some branches of industry a situation might arise in which wages fall below the value of labour-power, rendering machinery superfluous.</p>
<p>For example, yanks invented a stone-breaking machine that the Brits did not adopt because the men who carry out this work is paid for such a small portion of labour it would not be worth the investment.</p>
<p>The distinction between the necessary and surplus sections of the day can vary significantly, due to geographic, temporal or industrial factors even if the difference between the quantity of labour needed to produce the machine and the total quantity of labour replaced by it remains constant.</p>
<p><em>518</em> Due to machines&rsquo; capacity to free production of all limitations regarding skill, strength etc., machinery throws all members of the family onto the labour market, thereby depreciating it.</p>
<p>To purchase the labour-power of a whole family of four might cost more than it formerly did to purchase the labour-power of one family member but four days&rsquo; labour takes the place of one day and the price falls in proportion to the excess of the surplus labour of four over the surplus labour of one.</p>
<p>In this way machinery exploits more people and increases the extent of exploitation.</p>
<p><em>Footnote on the feminisation of the labour force</em></p>
<p><em>519</em> On patriarchal relations within the family under capitalism.</p>
<p><em>526</em> Machinery is the most powerful means of lengthening the working day beyond all natural limits.</p>
<p><em>527</em> The productivity of machinery is inversely proportional to the value transferred to it by the product. The longer it functions the greater the mass of products over which the value transmitted by the machine is spread and the smaller the portion of that value added to each single commodity.</p>
<p>The active lifetime of the machine is dependent on the length of the working day, the duration of the daily labour process and the number of days for which the process is carried on.</p>
<p>The amount of deterioration suffered by a machine does not correspond to the length of time it has been in use.</p>
<p><em>528</em> A machine deteriorates in three ways:
i) use, which is proportional to the use of the machine
ii) lack of use, which is inversely proportional
iii) loss of exchange value through better machines of the same kind being produced more cheaply.</p>
<p>In the third instance value is no longer determined by the necessary labour-time objectified within it but the labour-time necessary to reproduce it or the better machine.</p>
<p><em>529</em> Increasing the number of workers being exploited requires increasing the quantity of raw materials and the amount of constant capital laid out in machines or buildings.</p>
<p>The lengthening of the working day, by contrast, permits an expansion of the scale of production without any change in the amount of capital invested in machinery and buildings.</p>
<p>In this second instance, surplus-value increases and the outlay necessary to obtain it diminishes.</p>
<p>Machine production ties capital to a form which is constantly capable of valorisation but on the other hand loses use-value and exchange value whenever it is not in contact with living labour; every hour the fixed capital is not being used the capitalist may be said to be losing money.</p>
<p><em>530</em> As machinery comes into general use in a particular section of production, the social value of the machine&rsquo;s product sinks to a general level.</p>
<p>Surplus value arises only from variable capital.</p>
<p>The amount of surplus value depends on the rate of surplus value and the number of workers simultaneously employed while the rate is determined by the relative duration of the day which is taken up by necessary labour versus surplus labour performed in the course of the working day.</p>
<p><em>531</em> The number of workers depends on the ratio of variable to constant capital.</p>
<p>However much machinery might increase surplus labour at the expense of necessary labour by raising its productive power, it attains this result only by diminishing the number of workers employed by a given amount of capital, turning formerly variable capital into constant.</p>
<p>This comes into view when a machine becomes general in industry; capitalists will try to extend the working day to secure compensation for the decrease in the relative number of labourers exploited by increasing not only relative but also absolute surplus labour.</p>
<p><em>532</em> Hence machinery sweeps away all customs and moral laws restricting the working day. This is how the instrument that can reduce labour time to an extent that is historically unprecedented becomes the means of turning the worker and his family into slaves at capital&rsquo;s disposal.</p>
<p><em>533</em> As machinery becomes generalised the longer working day is compatible only with a lower degree of intensity; the higher intensity labour is only compatible with a shorter working day, as was seen after legislation was introduced to restrict the working day&rsquo;s length in England.</p>
<p><em>534</em> Capital attempts to increase relative surplus value by increasing worker productivity. The same amount of labour is exerted, but this unchanged amount of exchange value is spread over more use-values, hence the value of each single commodity falls.</p>
<p>The reduction in working hours gives an immense impetus to the development of productivity; a denser working day crystallises more hours of labour.</p>
<p><em>545</em> One of the key differences between manufacture and industry is the machine transfers the worker&rsquo;s skill to the machine, separating them it from human labour power.</p>
<p>This destroys manufacture&rsquo;s hierarchy of specialised workers; the work to be done in an industrial factory is brought down to an identical level, with the occasional exception of those who maintain the machine and thereby retain some form of specialised technical or engineering acumen.</p>
<p><em>546</em> Workers can therefore be continually replaced without any interruption to the production process.</p>
<p><em>554</em> The antagonism that exists between capital and labour is present under manufacture and legible in e.g. protest action characterised by the smashing of machines but it reaches a new, higher stage here.</p>
<p><em>556</em> The new colonial markets put pressure on urban workers as well as the rural population who had been kicked off their land as feudalism declines.</p>
<p><em>557</em> The division of labour reduces a worker&rsquo;s role on the market to the level of a tool-handler; when it becomes the job of the machine to handle the tool the use-value of the worker&rsquo;s labour power vanishes, along with its exchange value.</p>
<p>This section of the working class is thereby rendered superfluous by machinery; flooding more accessible sections of the labour market with their labour power and thereby bringing about a general decline in the price of labour-power in general.</p>
<p><em>559</em> This antagonism is clearest when new machinery enters into competition with handicrafts or manufactures handed down from former times, but the substance of the relationship is analogous when improvements are introduced in an industrial context.</p>
<p><em>561</em> Historical material on the effects of the American civil war on the cotton market.</p>
<p><em>563</em> Further material on how workers recognise this antagonism and respond to it; how the introduction of an invention for dressing warps in the printing industry led to a strike.</p>
<p><em>565</em> Proof that demonstrates that workers thrown off the labour market by machines are not re-meployed, against arguments to the contrary provided by bourgeois economists.</p>
<p><em>570</em> Machinery might increase employment in certain sectors but in overall terms it puts labourers out of jobs and does not compensate them for this loss.</p>
<p>We could only say that the amount of labour required to produce a commodity had been diminished if the total quantity of an article produced by a machine was less than or equal to the amount of an article produced by handicraft or manufacture but in fact the total quantity of the article produced by machinery with a diminished number of workers exceeds that amount by orders of magnitude; we can see this by the increase of raw materials which industrial production made necessary.</p>
<p>The further machinery extends in a given industry the more production is increased in other industries which provide the first sector with means of production.</p>
<p><em>571</em> Machinery greatly increased the number of men working in coal and metal mines (Marx notes that at time of writing this trend is reversing as mining becomes more mechanised).</p>
<p>The development of a cotton spinning machine promoted the cotton industry in the US and the slave-trade as well as slave-breeding.</p>
<p><em>572</em> Similarly transformed Ireland from arable land into pasture as well as reducing its population by half.</p>
<p>As machinery increases the mass of raw materials, half-finished products and instruments of labour, these processes are split into innumerable sub-divisions. The division of labour therefore occurs in industrial production to a far greater extent than in manufacture.</p>
<p><em>573</em> The relatively diminished number of workers required to produce the means of subsistence and the increasing wealth of particular social strata begets new markets for luxury goods; a larger potion of the social product is converted into surplus product and a larger portion of this is reproduced and consumed in a multitude of refined shapes.</p>
<p>Colonial markets also diversify production; not only are greater quantities of foreign luxury articles exchanged for home products but a greater mass of raw materials, ingredients and half-finished articles from overseas are used as means of production in domestic industry.</p>
<p>New branches of production are opened up in infrastructural investment such as canals, docks, tunnels, bridges etc.</p>
<p><em>574</em> As does non-productive employment for the working class; in services, as domestic servants etc.</p>
<p><em>575 - 7</em> Orthodox bourgeois economists defend the horrors industrialisation unleashes on the working class by arguing that it increases the number of jobs but in fact the numbers employed decrease; where increases are seen they primarily consist of women or people under 18.</p>
<p><em>578</em> When industrial production first becomes generalised capitalists recoup historically unprecedented profits. Additional social capital is constantly being created and seeking new areas of investment.</p>
<p><em>579</em> Once the factory system has reached a point of maturity, Marx defines this as the point at which its machinery is being produced by machinery in the metallurgical or mining industries and the means of transportation have been revolutionised, its only limitations are the availability of raw materials and effective demand.</p>
<p>[Imperialism]</p>
<p>Machinery dramatically increases the amount of available raw materials; their cheapness provide weapons for the conquest of foreign markets (both figurative and literal) which forcibly convert them into fields for the production of raw materials; in this way India is compelled to produce cotton + wool for England.</p>
<p>Foreign lands are also colonised and converted into settlements for growing raw materials for the benefit of industry in the mother country, e.g. Australia.</p>
<p><em>580</em> This converts one part of the globe into a chiefly agricultural field of production for supplying the other part, which remains industrial, dividing labour on an international or global scale.</p>
<p>This also creates the possibility of over-production; industry becomes prone to a series of periods characterised by alternation from moderate activity, prosperity, over-production, crisis, stagnation, unemployment (feverish production -&gt; glut on the market -&gt; contraction of the market -&gt; crippling of production)</p>
<p><em>588</em> Example of the state backing capitalist production by preventing workers from emigrating.</p>
<p><em>589</em> Example of the transition from handicraft to manufacture to industry in the English ribbon industry.</p>
<p><em>591</em> Until the strength of the worker becomes autonomous of the production process emoloyment of children in industry would not have been possible.</p>
<p><em>602 - 3</em> Some examples of the transitional forms which develop in particular industries, which in turn determine which machines predominate in in these sectors, the period of time it has been in operation, the condition of the workers, the degree to which manufacture, handicrafts or domestic industry predominates.</p>
<p>A concrete examination of the dress industry reveals that machinery subsists within a system of manufacture.</p>
<p>This tendency does not, of course, conceal the tendency which is operating to transform them into the factory system proper; steam power delivers the final blow.</p>
<p><em>604</em> How the regulations introduced by the Factory Acts further accelerates industrialisation and the introduction of steam power.</p>
<p><em>609</em> Capitalists will regard any attempt at regulating their activity via the state as a barrier and obstructed the activity of factory inspectors.</p>
<p><em>611</em> Though the acts have been successful in offering partial redress to seasonal cycles of employment and unemployment, spreading the work more evenly throughout the year inadequacies still prevail, as in the Irish flax industry where maimings and fatal injuries remain common.</p>
<p><em>612</em> Against the dogma of free trade, capitalism impedes all rational improvement past a certain point; an obligation to provide sufficient ventilation space to ensure the workers remain healthy would strike at the very logic of capital accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 16: Absolute and Relative Surplus Value</strong></p>
<p><em>643</em> As labour becomes increasingly social each component part of the universal totality of labouring power becomes increasingly separated from every other part.</p>
<p><em>644</em> Bourgeois economists have historically equated the production of surplus value with productivity in general. As such their conception of productivity has varied in line with the variations in surplus value.</p>
<p><em>645</em> Absolute surplus value refers to the extension of the working day.</p>
<p>This is the starting point of the capitalist system, and also the point at which relative surplus-value becomes possible, as this requires that the working day be divided into two parts - one in which necessary labour is taking place and another in which surplus value is being generated.</p>
<p>Relative surplus value is increased by reducing the amount of socially necessary labour. The increase in the amount of absolute surplus being generated depends on the length of the working day, while an increase in relative surplus requires the revolutionising of the technical processes of labour.</p>
<p>This is the essence of the capitalist mode of production and it develops or is extended firstly through formal subsumption of capital under labour and secondly through real subsumption.</p>
<p><em>[Historical transition to capitalism]</em></p>
<p>While at early stages of capitalist construction surplus value may not be extracted through compulsion or force, capital has not yet subordinated labour, or developed total control over the labour process.</p>
<p>One example may be the merchant or usurer who steps between independent producers and the market in the middle ages. Though this is not capitalism, Marx suggests it may be a hybrid form and lay the necessary foundations.</p>
<p>Absolute surplus value may be produced under formal subsumption; all that is necessary here is for a handicraftsmen who previously worked for themselves or apprentices of a master to become wage labourers under a capitalist.</p>
<p><em>646</em> Methods of increasing relative surplus-value are at the same time means of securing increases in absolute surplus value, as the extension of the working day is a central fixture of large-scale industry.</p>
<p>The capitalist mode of production ceases to be a mere means of the generation of surplus value once it has conquered an entire branch of industry and especially when it has captured all of the most important branches.</p>
<p>It only continues to be the exceptional method of generating surplus value insofar as it seizes on industries only formally subordinate to capital and secondly insofar as these industries already seized are further revolutionised.</p>
<p>The distinction between relative and absolute surplus value may appear illusory, as relative surplus value is at the same time absolute; it requires the worker to work beyond those limits of the working day which are necessary to reproduce the workers&rsquo; condition of existence, and secondly absolute is relative; it requires as it requires the development of the productivity of labour, allowing necessary labour time to be restricted to a specific portion of the day.</p>
<p>But in fact this similarity is illusory and this is clear once the imperative is felt to elevate the rate of surplus value.</p>
<p>Assuming labour power is paid for at its value, if productivity of labour and its normal degree of intensity is given, its rate can only be raised by increasing the length of the working day, in absolute terms.</p>
<p>If the length of the working day is given, the rate of surplus value can be raised only by a change in the relative magnitudes of the working day, necessary as compared with surplus labour.</p>
<p>If wages are not to fall below the value of labour-power, this change presupposes a change in either the productivity or the intensity of labour.</p>
<p><em>647 - 8</em> Notes on the nature of civilisation in pre-history and leisure time in satisfying social and physical requirements - Egyptian civilisation had the scope to develop to the extent that it did because of the extent of leisure time that was available once physical needs had been satisfied in that place and time.</p>
<p><em>649</em> This does not mean that capitalism is established wherever the soil is most fertile; there is a line + a footnote about how the ready satisfaction of physical needs can constrain development as it makes people careless and proud rather than vigilant and abstemious.</p>
<p>It is the variety of natural products which form the basis of the  division of labour, the necessity of bringing a natural force under society&rsquo;s control. Examples provided include the development of irrigation in India, the regulation of water in Holland and Egypt.</p>
<p><em>650</em> Favourable natural conditions offer only the possibility, not the guarantee of surplus; natural requirements themselves vary from place to place.</p>
<p><em>651</em> Surplus time may be available but whether or not this leisure time is deployed productively depends on these contextual factors.</p>
<p>In this way capitalism is historically and socially determined; surplus is not an inherent quality.</p>
<p><em>652 - 654</em> Critiques of Mill and Ricardo.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 17: Changes of Magnitude in the Price of Labour-Power and in Surplus-Value</em></p>
<p><em>655</em> The value of labour-power is determined by the value of the means of subsistence.</p>
<p>Subsistence requirements vary according to social, historical economic factors.</p>
<p>The cost of developing this power is important, as is the natural diversity of labour-power, the difference between the labour-power of men as compared with women and children, these are all crucial in opening up the vast differences in the costs of reproducing the worker and his family.</p>
<p>Relative magnitudes of surplus values therefore depend on</p>
<p>i) the length of the working day or the extensive magnitude of labour
ii) the normal intensity of labour or its intensive magnitude
iii) the productivity of labour, whereby the same quantity of labour yields, in a given time, a greater or lesser quantity of the product.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 19: The Transformation of the Value (and respectively the price) of Labour-Power into Wages</strong></p>
<p><em>675</em> Bourgeois economists regard the price of labour as its value, but the value of a commodity is the amount of socially necessary labour-time it took to produce it.</p>
<p><em>676</em> A direct exchange of objectified labour power in money for labour-power would represent a violation of the law of value; in a capitalist society, this is not the way things are done.</p>
<p>If the worker did receive the value of his labour-power in the form of money it would follow that the worker was producing no surplus, which is also incompatible with the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>Nor is it the case that surplus arises out of the difference between wages and recouped surplus.</p>
<p><em>677</em> The notion of a &lsquo;value of labour&rsquo; is in fact an abstraction, labour has no value, rather value is immanent to it.</p>
<p><em>678</em> Supply and demand therefore cannot explain the value of labour, even when we take an ideal average across an entire economy over a specific length of time, because a wage is just an accidental value or quantity. It cannot be calculated as a mere cost of production as some attempted to do.</p>
<p><em>680</em> Part of the reason for this is that it is part of the capitalist mode of production that it is never clear that the worker is working for free; surplus and necessary labour are obfuscated in the labour process.</p>
<p><em>681</em> Wages fluctuate independently of the value of labour-power, which depends on broader factors.</p>
<p><em>682</em> The capitalist doesn&rsquo;t perceive this difference either; it is rather in the nature of the market, wherein the capitalist buys as cheaply as possible and seels as high as possible; it appears to them that this is the source of thier profits.</p>
<p><em>[Slavery]</em></p>
<p>Under slavery the advantage / disadvantage of labour-power above / below the average falls on the slaveholder, while under capitalism it rebounds to the worker.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 20: Time-Wages</strong></p>
<p><em>683</em> A worker may receive vastly different sums of money for the same quantity of labour.</p>
<p><em>684</em> The average price of labour is the average value of labour-power divided by the average number of hours in the working day.</p>
<p>In this sense the price of labour is not the same as wages; they may move independently of one another.</p>
<p><em>685</em> However as a general law it follows that given the amount of daily, weekly labour, the daily weekly wage depends on the price of labour, which itself varies either with the value of labour-power or with the divergences between its price and its value.</p>
<p>Given the price of labour, on the other hand, the daily or weekly wage depends on the quantity of labour expended weekly or daily.</p>
<p>The unit of measurement for time wages, the price of the working hour, is the value of a day&rsquo;s labour power divided by the number of hours in the average working day.</p>
<p>This is not a tautology because it indicates the amount of hours the worker has to labour in order to reproduce their conditions of existence. If their minimum working hours do not attain a certain threshold surplus is generated, but not the amount of value required to allow the worker to reproduce their own conditions of existence.</p>
<p><em>686</em> This is how underemployment, as opposed to over-work can have deleterious consequences for the worker.</p>
<p><em>689</em> The artificial shortening of the working day increases competition between workers, allowing the employer to reduce the price of labour (with the average price of the total number of weekly hours decreasing) and thereafter reduce wages, which allows him to increase the hours of work.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter Twenty-One: Piece-Wages</strong></p>
<p><em>694</em> Quantifying the amount of value in a commodity generated in a context in which the worker is being paid according to output is not a matter of calculating duration but rather the amount of products in which the labour has been embodied during a given time.</p>
<p>The quality of the output is also an important factor in the payment of piece-wages, a certain average standard must be maintained. In this way piece-wages become an important site of struggle between the worker and the capitalist regarding standards and remuneration.</p>
<p><em>695</em> It is also a form of work in which it is straightforward for various kinds of capitalist parasites to interpose themselves between the worker and the capitalist, as in the &lsquo;sweating system&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is in the interests of the workers to strain his labour power as intensely as possible, this also makes it easier for the capitalist to raise the intensity of labour.</p>
<p><em>696</em> These individual differences between strength and skill of the workers form an average, as in wage labour.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 22: National Differences in Wages</strong></p>
<p><em>701</em> Calculating how these laws governing the transformation of labour-power into the price of labour power and then into wages function on a national level requires bearing in mind the level of subsistence requirements or what factors determine the changes in the value of labour power; subsistence according to historical and social developments, cost of training to workers, role of women and children etc.</p>
<p><em>702</em> The average intensity of labour varies from nation to nation and expresses itself in greater or lesser amounts of money.</p>
<p>As each nation arrives at an average labour, this happens at an international scale also.</p>
<p>Law of value is further distorted on an international level in instances where the more productive nation is not compelled to lower the prices of their commodities by competition to their value.</p>
<p>Capitalist production rises in proportion with the intensity and productivity of labour. Different quantities of commodities of the same type, produced in different countries at the same working time therefore possess unequal national values which express themselves in different prices.</p>
<p>The relative value of money will therefore be less in a nation with a relatively developed capitalism than those which are less developed. Nominal wages will threfore be higher in the former than the latter, which is not to say that their purchasing power will extend further.</p>
<p><em>705</em> Example of a bourgeois economist who seeks to link wages with productivity, and argue that the state exerts a distorting influence on the market, rather than, as Marx argues, functions as a guarantor.</p>
<p><em>Part Seven: The Process of Accumulation of Capital</em></p>
<p><em>709 - 10</em> The transformation of money into means of production and labour-power is the first phase of the movement that value is to undergo when it is transformed into capital. The second phase, circulation, is complete once the means of production have been converted into commodities whose value exceeds that of their component parts, i.e. when it contains the capital originally advanced, as well as a surplus.</p>
<p>These commodities will then have their value realised as money by being sold and the revenue will be transformed again into capital and so on.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this section Marx assumes that this circulation of capital takes place frictionlessly. On that basis we are not concerned with the forms capital assumes when in the sphere of circulation.</p>
<p>The capitalist who extracts surplus value from the workers and fixes it in commodities is the first appropriator of surplus value but he is not its ultimate proprietor, rather he shares the surplus with other capitalists who fulfill other social functions. Surplus-value is therefore split into various parts, its fragments fall to various categories of person and takes on various independent forms, such as profit, interest, rent. These are taken up in Volume 3, but here we take the capitalist producer as their representative.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 23: Simple Reproduction</em></p>
<p><em>711</em> Whatever the mode of production it has to take place continuously, periodically reproducing its distinct phases; in this way the reproduction of capitalist production too has a capitalist form.</p>
<p><em>712</em> If the revenue the capitalist recoups from the surplus serves the ends of his consumption and is consumed as periodically as it is gained, simple reproduction taken place, meaning a mere repetition of the process of production on the same scale as before.</p>
<p>The purchase of the worker&rsquo;s labour-power for a fixed period is the prelude to the production process. But the worker is not paid until after he has expended his labour-power and realised both the value of his labour-power and a certain quantity of surplus-value in the shape of commodities; he has therefore produced not only surplus-value but also the variable capital, the fund, out of which he is paid.</p>
<p><em>713</em> The capitalist class therefore gives to the worker drafts, in the form of money, on a portion of the product produced by the latter and appropriated by the former. The workers give these drafts back just as constantly to the capitalist and thereby withdraw from the latter their allotted share of their own product; this transaction is veiled by the commodity form of the product and the money-form of the commodity.</p>
<p><em>716</em> This is a process which is constantly renewed and perpetuated. Production converts natural wealth into capital, both the capitalist&rsquo;s means of enjoyment and his means of valorisation while the worker always leaves the production process in the same condition he entered into it.</p>
<p><em>717</em> For the worker there are two types of consumption. While producing he consumes the means of production with his labour, converting them into products with a higher value than that of the capital advanced; this is productive consumption. It is at the same time consumption of his labour-power by the capitalist who bought it.</p>
<p>On the other hand the worker uses his wages to buy his means of subsistence. The worker&rsquo;s productive consumption and his individual consumption are distinct; in the former he acts as the motive power of capital, and belongs to the capitalist, in the latter he belongs to himself and performs necessary vital functions outside the production process. Marx describes as the worker&rsquo;s individual consumption as an abuse, rather than an essential attribute of the capitalist mode of production because all the capitalist cares for is to reduce the worker&rsquo;s individual consumption to a necessary minimum.</p>
<p><em>719</em> In this sense the working class, when it stands outside the direct labour process, is just as much an appendage of capital as the lifeless instruments of labour. Even its individual consumption is - within certain limits - a mere aspect of the process of capital&rsquo;s reproduction.</p>
<p>Individual consumption provides on the one hand, the means for the worker&rsquo;s maintenance and reproduction and on the other their continued re-appearance on the labour-market.</p>
<p><em>723</em> Capitalist production therefore continually reproduces the separation between labour-power and the conditions of labour; it reproduces and perpetuates the conditions under which the worker is exploited, forces him to sell his labour-power to live and enables the capitalist to purchase his labour-power power so he can enrich himself.</p>
<p>In this sense it is not an accident that the capitalist and worker encounter one another in the market as buyer or seller, but rather the alternating rhythm of the process itself which throws the worker back onto the market as a seller of his labour power.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 24: The Transformation of Surplus-Value into Capital</em></p>
<p><em>726</em> A capital-value is initially advanced in the form of money, initiating the productive process. If this is sold and converted into money it regains its original form as capital-value.</p>
<p>Accumulation requires a portion of the surplus product to be converted into capital, but we cannot transform into capital anything but such articles as can be employed in the labour process and such further articles are as suitable for the sustenance of the worker.</p>
<p><em>727</em> Consequently, a part of the annual surplus labour must have been applied to the production of additional means of production and subsistence, over and above the quantity of these things required to replace the capital advanced. In other words, surplus-value can be transformed into capital only because the surplus product already comprises the material components of a new quantity of capital.</p>
<p>In order for these components to function as capital the capitalist class requires additional labour, if the exploitation of workers already employed does not increase, additional labour-powers must be enlisted.</p>
<p>Capitalist production allows for this by the creation and reproduction of a class of labourers who depend on wages.</p>
<p><em>733 - 5</em> The commodities the capitalist buys as part of the surplus-value for his own consumption do not serve as means of production or means of valorisation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the labour he buys for satisfaction of his natural and social requirements do not serve as productive labour. Instead of transforming surplus-value into capital he consumes or expends it as revenue when he purchases those commodities and that labour.</p>
<p><em>736</em> Bourgeois economists are correct to maintain the consumption of the surplus product by productive workers is a characteristic feature of accumulation, but they are wrong to present it as this and nothing else. Surplus value is divided into constant and variable capital. The labour-power is consumed by the capitalist while the means of production are consumed by the labour-power in the exercise of its function, e.g. labour.</p>
<p><em>738</em> The argument that it is the workers who consume the net product is capitalist apologia.</p>
<p>The surplus value or surplus product is both the means of capital accumulation and the means through which the capitalist satisfies his own consumption requirements.</p>
<p><em>739</em> Through the capitalist&rsquo;s fanatical desire to further accumulate he forces the human race to produce for production&rsquo;s sake, spurs the development of society&rsquo;s productive forces and the creation of the material conditions for a higher form of society. This development requires the increasing laying out of a constantly increasing amount of capital in a given industrial undertaking; competition subordinates every capitalist to external and coercive laws.</p>
<p><em>741</em> At an earlier phase in capitalist development this avaricious drive to accumulate is what drives the capitalist forward, credit arises at a mature phase and becomes a business necessity.</p>
<p><em>747 - 8</em> The magnitude of accumulation depends on the mass of surplus value.</p>
<p>The rate of surplus value depends on the degree of the exploitation of labour power; reduction of wages below the value of labour-power is therefore an important source of raising the rate of surplus value extracted from the labour process; the tendency of capital is therefore to force the cost of labour back to zero.</p>
<p><em>749 - 50</em> Examples of measures taken to this end, up to and including theft from the workers&rsquo; consumption fund.</p>
<p><em>751 - 2</em> Across extractive, classical industry and agriculture examples of how increased exploitation of labour power is what drives accumulation rather than increasing constant capital, with a view to underlining that with labour-power and land capital acquires a power of expansion that allows it to accumulate beyond the apparent limits of its own magnitude.</p>
<p>The mass of products in which a given value is embodied increases with the productivity of labour.</p>
<p><em>752 - 3</em> Series of examples of how the ratio between mass:rate, consumption: accumulation fund can vary but the increase in productivity and accumulation will always rebound to the detriment of the worker; increasing productivity of labour is accompanied by a cheapening of labour-power.</p>
<p>It also allows for replacement of and more efficient use of old machinery.</p>
<p><em>756</em> This appears as an increase in the capacities of capital.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 25: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation</em></p>
<p><strong>1. A Growing Demand for Labour-Power Accompanies Accumulation if the Composition of Capital Remains the Same</strong></p>
<p><em>762</em> The composition of capital is determined by the proportion in which it is divided into constant capital (means of production, the value composition or organic composition) and variable capital (the value of labour power, the sum total of all wages, the technical composition).</p>
<p>This varies across sector but forms an average.</p>
<p><em>763</em> Growth of capital implies a growth in the wage fund.</p>
<p>Since the total social capital produces a surplus every year of which one part is added to the capital every year, a point will eventually be reached at which the demands of capital is not equal to the supply of labour and wages will rise.</p>
<p><em>765</em> Accumulation of capital therefore brings about an increase in the size of the labouring population.</p>
<p><em>768 - 9</em> This increased share in the surplus product may allow the labourer to increase their consumption fund, increase their stock of material comforts and save more but it does not change the fundamentally exploitative relationship that exists between labourer and capitalist - an increase in wages merely means a reduction in the amount of unpaid labour the worker has to provide to the capitalist.</p>
<p><em>770</em> Either this reduction in the amount of unpaid labour in no way interferes with the accumulation process and the domain of capital continues to extend, or it does, and the impetus that led to the increase in wages in the first place, a disproportion between capital and labour, slackens. In this way the capitalist mode of production removes those obstacles it creates and the price of labour falls to the level adequate to capital&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>It is the accumulation of capital which acts upon the wage rate, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>A Relative Diminution in the Variable Part of Capital Occurs in the Course of Further Progress of Accumulation and of the Concentration Accompanying It</strong></p>
<p><em>772</em> A point is reached in the course of accumulation that the development of the social productivity of labour is the most important lever of accumulation.</p>
<p><em>773</em> This is expressed in the relative extent of the means of production that one worker, in a given time and by a given intensity, produces products.</p>
<p>Some of this increase is due to productivity gains secured by the division of labour, together with the application of machinery, more raw materials may be worked upon. On the other hand the mass of machinery, beasts of burden, means of transport are important.</p>
<p>This growth in the mass of the means of production expresses itself in the growth of the organic composition of capital relative to the technical component; an important source of accumulation is therefore also an increase in exploitation.</p>
<p><em>774</em> Accumulation therefore lessens the relative magnitude of the variable part of capital but this does not exclude the possibility of a rise in its absolute magnitude.</p>
<p><em>775</em> The development of capitalism, large-scale industry, the accumulation of capital in the hands of individual producers represents a necessary starting point. This is called primitive accumulation.</p>
<p><em>776</em> The growth of many individual capitals concentrates wealth in the hands of individual capitalists and forms a broader social capital. Simultaneously offshoots split off from the original capitals and function as new independent capitals.</p>
<p><em>777</em> The concept of centralisation is introduced here, which is the concentration of capitals already formed, the destruction of their individual independence, the expropriation of capitalist by capitalist.</p>
<p>This process is distinct from accumulation in the sense that it presupposes a change in the distribution of capital that is already available and already functioning. Its field of action is not limited by the absolute growth of social wealth or he absolute limits of accumulation, it is rather zero-sum, capital grows in one place because it has been lost in another.</p>
<p>Competition is fought by the cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities depends on the productivity of labour and this depends on the scale of production; big capitals beat the smaller.</p>
<p>It will be recalled that with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. Smaller capitals therefore move into  spheres of production which large-scale industry has taken only incomplete or sporadic control.</p>
<p>Here competition occurs in direct proportion to the number, and in inversse proportion to the magnitude of the rival capitals; it always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists.</p>
<p><em>779</em> As competition develops so too do technical instruments necessary to centralisation of capital, such as credit. These developments renders the motive force behind centralisation stronger than historically.</p>
<p>Centralisation does not depend on positive growth in the magnitude of social capita; this is what distinguishes centralisation from concentration, this being another name for reproduction on a larger scale.</p>
<p>Centralisation may result from a mere change in the distribution of already existing capitals, from a simple alteration in the quantitative grouping of the component parts of social capital.</p>
<p>Centralisation supplements the work of accumulation by enabling industrial capitalists to extend the scale of their operations, whether as a consequence of  accumulation or centralisation, violent annexation or the fusion of a number of capitals through the organising of joint-stock companies.</p>
<p><em>780</em> But the gradual increase of capital by reproduction is a very slow procedure compared with centralisation, as the latter needs only to change the quantitative groupings of the constituent parts of social capital. If the construction of railways depended on the accumulation of capital it would have taken longer; with centralisation it was accomplished far quicker due to joint-stock companies.</p>
<p>Centralisation speeds up accumulation and its effects and it also accelerates revolutions in the technical composition of capital which raise its constant portion at the expense of its variable portion, diminishing the relative demand for labour.</p>
<p><em>781</em> The accumulation of capital comes to fruition through through a contuining increase of its constant component at the expense of its variable component.</p>
<p>The capitalist mode of production, and the change in the organic composition of capital, do not merely keep pace with the progress of accumulation;l they develop at a much quicker rate, because the absolute expansion of total social capital is accompanied by the centralisation of its individual elements, the demand for variable capital declines with a greater amount of accumulation.</p>
<p><em>782</em> This relative diminution of the relative component takes place at the same time as an absolute increase in the working population, which moves more rapidly. Capital accumulation therefore constantly produces a relatively redundant working population superfluous to capital&rsquo;s average valorisation requirements.</p>
<p>The composition of capital differs across sectors; in some industrial areas it might change without any increase in its absolute magnitude and just as a consequence of simple concentration, or additional labour is attracted on the basis of its increasing technical basis, the point is that across all spheres the increase in the variable parts of capital and the number of workers employed by it, is always connected with violent fluctuations and the temporary production of a surplus population.</p>
<p><em>783</em> The greater magnitude of social capital, its greater productive capacity extends the scale at which capital is capable of attracting workers, but it also repels them; in this sense workers reproduce both the accumulation of capital and the means by which they themselves are made relatively superfluous.</p>
<p><em>784 - 5</em> This surplus population becomes a condition for the existence of the capitalist mode of production as it forms an industrial reserve army, always ready to be thrown into decisive sectors of production at any point in a given industrial cycle.</p>
<p><em>788</em> The number of workers under capital may remain the same or fall while the variable capital increases, as would be the case if the industrial worker provided more labour and his wages increased, though the price of labour remains the same or falls, more slowly than the mass of labour rises. An increase of variable capital therefore becomes an index of more labour, but not of workers employed. It is in fact in the interest of every capitalist to extort a given quantity of labour out of a smaller rather than a greater number of workers, if the cost is the same.</p>
<p>As the capitalist mode of production develops the capitalist buys with the same capital a greater quantity of labour-power as he progressively replaces skilled workers with less skilled workers, mature labour-power with immature.</p>
<p>Therefore as accumulation develops a larger variable capital sets more labour in motion without enlisting more workers, while a variable capital of the same magnitude mobilises more labour with the same mass of labour power; finally, a greater number of inferior labour-power is set in motion by the displacement of more skilled labour-powers.</p>
<p><em>789</em> The production of a relative surplus population therefore proceeds more rapidly than the technical transformation of the process of production that accompanies the advance of accumulation and is accelerated by it, and more rapidly than the corresponding diminiution of the variable part of capital as compared with the constant.</p>
<p>If the means of production are less and less sources of employment this relation is modified by the fact that as the productivity of labour increases, capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for workers. The over-work of the employed part of the working class swells the rank of its reserve, while the greater pressure that the reserve, by its competition exerts on the employed workers forces them to submit to over-work and the dictates of capital.</p>
<p><em>790</em> The general movement of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army and this in turn corresponds with the periodic alternations of the industrial cycle.</p>
<p>They are not therefore determined by population but by the varying proportions in which the working class is divided into an active or a reserve army, as opposed to, as the bourgeois economists do, regard population as the most important factor.</p>
<p><em>792</em> If accumulation in a particular sphere of production becomes active and profits in it, becoming greater than average, attract additional capital, than the demand for labour, as well as wages, rise within it. These higher wages draw in a larger part of the working population until it is glutted with labour power and wages fall again to their average level. At this point the influx of workers not only ceases but leads to an outflow.</p>
<p>The political economist thinks he sees an absolute diminution of workers accompanying an increase of wages, and a diminution of wages accompanying an increase of workers but what he is looking at is only the local oscillations of the labour-market in a particular sphere of production.</p>
<p>During periods of stagnation and average prosperity, the industrial reserve army weighs down the active army of workers, during periods of over-production and feverish activity it puts a curb on their pretensions.</p>
<p><em>793</em> The demand for labour is therefore not identical with the increase of capital; it is not a case of two independent forces working on each other, capital acts on both sides at once; if its accumulation on the one hand increases the demand for labour, it increases on the other the supply of workers by &lsquo;setting them free, while at the same time the pressure of the unemployed compels those who are employed to a certain extent independent of the supply of workers.</p>
<p><em>795</em> Note about how the institution of marriage is dictated by capital accumulation.</p>
<p><em>796</em> A specific category within the relative surplus population is stagnant: its conditions fall below the average normal level of the working class and these are characterised by a maximum of working time and a minimum of wages. It is constantly recruited from workers in large-scale industry and manufacture who have become unemployed, especially from those decaying branches of industry where handicraft is giving way to manufacture and manufacture to machinery.</p>
<p><em>797</em> The lowest sediment of the relative surplus population is the lumpenproletariat, composed of criminals, vagabonds and prostitutes. It consists of three categories; those able to work, orphans and pauper children who ar, in times of prosperity, speedily recruited as workers and third the demoralised, the ragged and those unable to work incapable and victims of industry, mutilated, injured, widows.</p>
<p><em>799</em> Argument is that in proportion as capital accumulates the situation of the worker grows worse.</p>

For his efforts to procure German arms for the Easter Rising, which would take place three days later, he was arrested on charges of high treason, sabotage and espionage against the Crown.</em></p>
<p><em>Casement&rsquo;s trial opened at the Royal Courts of Justice on 26 June 1916. He was found guilty and hanged, one of sixteen Irish men executed in the immediate aftermath of the Rising for their attempts to free their country from the most powerful Empire on the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><em>After the verdict of guilty was returned Casement delivered a speech in defense of Ireland&rsquo;s right to rebellion.</em></p>
<p>My Lord Chief Justice, as I wish my words to reach a much wider audience than I see before me here, I intend to read all that I propose to say. What I shall read now is something I wrote more than twenty days ago. I may say at once, my lord, that I protest against the jurisdiction of this court in my case on this charge, and the argument that I am now going to read is addressed not to this court, but to my own countrymen. There is an objection, possibly not good in law, but surely good on moral grounds, against the application to me here of this old English statute, 565 years old, that seeks to deprive an Irishman today of life and honour, not for adhering to the King&rsquo;s enemies, but for adhering to his own people.</p>
<p>When this statute was passed in 1351, what was the state of men&rsquo;s minds on the question of a far higher allegiance — that of a man to God and His kingdom? The law of that day did not permit a man to forsake his Church, or deny his God, save with his life. The &lsquo;heretic&rsquo;, then, had the same doom as the &rsquo;traitor&rsquo;. Today a man may forswear God and His heavenly kingdom without fear or penalty — all earlier statutes having gone the way of Nero&rsquo;s edicts against the Christians; but that constitutional phantom &rsquo;the King&rsquo; can still dig up from the dungeons and torture-chambers of the Dark Ages a law that takes a man&rsquo;s life and limb for an exercise of conscience.</p>
<p>If true religion rests on love, it is equally true that loyalty rests on love. The law that I am charged under has no parentage in love, and claims the allegiance of today on the ignorance and blindness of the past. I am being tried, in truth, not by my peers of the live present, but by the fears of the dead past; not by the civilization of the twentieth century, but by the brutality of the fourteenth; not even by a statute framed in the language of the land that tries me, but emitted in the language of an enemy land — so antiquated is the law that must be sought today to slay an Irishman, whose offence is that he puts Ireland first! Loyalty is a sentiment, not a law. It rests on love, not on restraint. The government of Ireland by England rests on restraint, and not on law; and since it demands no love, it can evoke no loyalty.</p>
<p>But this statute is more absurd even than it is antiquated; and if it be potent to hang even one Irishman, it is still more potent to gibbet all Englishmen. Edward III was king, not only of the realm of England, but also of the realm of France, and he was not king of Ireland. Yet his dead hand to-day may pull the noose around the Irishman&rsquo;s neck, whose sovereign he was not, but it can strain no strand around the Frenchman&rsquo;s throat, whose sovereign he was. For centuries, the successors of Edward III claimed to be kings of France, and quartered the arms of France on their royal shield down to the Union with Ireland on January 1st, 1801. Throughout these hundreds of years, these &lsquo;kings of France&rsquo; were constantly at war with their realm of France and their French subjects, who should have gone from birth to death with an obvious fear of treason before their eyes. But did they? Ddid the &lsquo;kings of France&rsquo; resident here at Windsor or in the Tower of London hang, draw and quarter as a traitor every Frenchman for four hundred years who fell into their power with arms in his hands? On the contrary, they received embassies of these traitors, presents from these traitors, even knighthood itself at the hands of these traitors, feasted with them, tilted with them, fought with them — but did not assassinate them by law.</p>
<p>Judicial assassination today is reserved only for one race of the King&rsquo;s subjects — for Irishmen, for those who cannot forget their allegiance to the realm of Ireland. The Kings of England as such had no rights in Ireland up to the time of Henry VIII, save such as rested on compact and mutual obligation entered into between them and certain princes, chiefs, and lords of Ireland. This form of legal right, such as it was, gave no King of England lawful power to impeach an Irishman for high treason under this statute of King Edward III of England until an Irish Act, known as Poyning&rsquo;s Law, the tenth of Henry VII, was passed in 1494 at Drogheda by the Parliament of the Pale in Ireland and enacted as law in that part of Ireland. But if by Poyning&rsquo;s Law an Irishman of the Pale could be indicted for high treason under this Act, he could be indicted only in one way, and before one tribunal — by the law of the Realm of Ireland and in Ireland. The very law of Poyning, which, I believe, applies this statute of Edward III to Ireland, enacted also for the Irishman&rsquo;s defence &lsquo;all those laws by which England claims her liberty&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And what is the fundamental charter of an Englishman&rsquo;s liberty? That he shall be tried by his peers. With all respect, I assert this court is to me, an Irishman, charged with this offence, a foreign court – this jury is for me, an Irishman, not a jury of my peers to try me on this vital issue, for it is patent to every man of conscience that I have a right, an indefeasible right, if tried at all, under this statute of high treason, to be tried in Ireland, before an Irish court and by an Irish jury. This court, this jury, the public opinion of this country, England, cannot but be prejudiced in varying degrees against me, most of all in time of war. I did not land in England. I landed in Ireland. It was to Ireland I came; to Ireland I wanted to come; and the last place I desired to land was in England.</p>
<p>But for the Attorney-General of England there is only England; there is no Ireland; there is only the law of England, no right of Ireland; the liberty of Ireland and of an Irishman is to be judged by the power of England. Yet for me, the Irish outlaw, there is a land of Ireland, a right of Ireland, and a charter for all Irishmen to appeal to, in the last resort, a charter that even the very statutes of England itself cannot deprive us of — nay more, a charter that Englishmen themselves assert as the fundamental bond of law that connects the two kingdoms. This charge of high treason involves a moral responsibility, as the very terms of the indictment against myself recite, inasmuch as I committed the acts I am charged with to &rsquo;the evil example of others in the like case&rsquo;. What was the evil example I set to others in the like case, and who were these others? The &rsquo;evil example&rsquo; charged is that I asserted the right of my own country, and &rsquo;the others&rsquo; to whom I appealed to aid my endeavour were my own countrymen. The example was given, not to Englishmen, but to Irishmen, and the &rsquo;like case&rsquo; can never arise in England, but only in Ireland. To Englishmen I set no evil example, for I made no appeal to them. I asked no Englishman to help me. I asked Irishmen to fight for their rights. The &rsquo;evil example&rsquo; was only to other Irishmen, who might come after me and in &rsquo;like case&rsquo; seek to do as I did. How, then, since neither my example nor my appeal was addressed to Englishmen, can I be rightfully tried by them?</p>
<p>If I did wrong in making that appeal to Irishmen to join with me in an effort to fight for Ireland, it is by Irishmen, and by them alone, I can be rightfully judged. From this court and its jurisdiction I appeal to those I am alleged to have wronged and to those I am alleged to have injured by my &rsquo;evil example&rsquo; and claim that they alone are competent to decide my guilt or innocence. If they find me guilty, the statute may affix the penalty, but the statute does not override or annul my right to seek judgment at their hands.</p>
<p>This is so fundamental a right, so natural a right, so obvious a right, that it is clear that the Crown were aware of it when they brought me by force and by stealth from Ireland to this country. It was not I who landed in England, but the Crown who dragged me here, away from my own country to which I had returned with a price upon my head, away from my own countrymen whose loyalty is not in doubt, and safe from the judgment of my peers whose judgment I do not shrink from. I admit no other judgment but theirs. I accept no verdict save at their hands.</p>
<p>I assert from this dock that I am being tried here, not because it is just, but because it is unjust. Place me before a jury of my own countrymen, be it Protestant or Catholic, Unionist or Nationalist, Sinn Féineach or Orangemen, and I shall accept the verdict, and bow to the statute and all its penalties. But I shall accept no meaner finding against me than that of those whose loyalty I have endangered by my example and to whom alone I made appeal. If they adjudge me guilty, then guilty I am. It is not I who am afraid of their verdict — it is the Crown. If this is not so, why fear the test? I fear it not. I demand it as my right.</p>
<p>This is the condemnation of English rule, of English-made law, of English government in Ireland, that it dare not rest on the will of the Irish people, but exists in defiance of their will: that it is a rule, derived not from right, but from conquest.</p>
<p>But conquest, my Lord, gives no title; and, if it exists over the body, it fails over the mind. It can exert no empire over men&rsquo;s reason and judgment and affections; and it is from this law of conquest without title to the reason, judgment, and affection of my own countrymen that I appeal. I would add that the generous expressions of sympathy extended to me from many quarters, particularly from America, have touched me very much. In that country, as in my own, I am sure my motives are understood, and not misjudged — for the achievement of their liberty has been an abiding inspiration to Irishmen, and to all men elsewhere, rightly struggling to be free in like cause.</p>
<p>My Lord Chief Justice, if I may continue, I am not called upon, I conceive, to say anything in answer to the inquiry your lordship has addressed to me why Sentence should not be passed upon me. Since I do not admit any verdict in this Court, I cannot, my lord, admit the fitness of the sentence that of necessity must follow it from this Court. I hope I shall be acquitted of presumption if I say that the Court I see before me now is not this High Court of Justice of England, but a far greater, a far higher, a far older assemblage of justices — that of the people of Ireland. Since in the acts which have led to this trial it was the people of Ireland I sought to serve — and them alone — I leave my judgment and my sentence in their hands.</p>
<p>Let me pass from myself and my own fate to a more pressing, as it is a far more urgent theme — not the fate of the individual Irishman who may have tried and failed, but the claims and the fate of the country that has not failed. Ireland has not failed. Ireland has outlived the failure of all her hopes — and she still hopes. Ireland has seen her sons — aye, and her daughters too! — suffer from generation to generation, always for the same cause, meeting always the same fate, and always at the hands of the same power. Still, always a fresh generation has passed on to withstand the same oppression. For if English authority be omnipotent — a power, as Mr Gladstone phrased it, that reaches to the very ends of the earth — Irish hope exceeds the dimensions of that power, excels its authority, and renews with each generation the claims of the last. The cause that begets this indomitable persistency, the faculty of preserving through centuries of misery the remembrance of lost liberty — this surely is the noblest cause ever man strove for, ever lived for, ever died for. If this be the cause I stand here to-day indicted for and convicted of sustaining, then I stand in a goodly company and a right noble succession.</p>
<p>My counsel has referred to the Ulster Volunteer movement, and I will not touch at length upon that ground save only to say this, that neither I nor any of the leaders of the Irish Volunteers who were founded in Dublin in November 1913, had any quarrel with the Ulster Volunteers as such, who were born a year earlier. Our movement was not directed against them, but against the men who misused and misdirected the courage, the sincerity and the local patriotism of the men of the north of Ireland. On the contrary, we welcomed the coming of the Ulster Volunteers, even while we deprecated the aims and intentions of those Englishmen who sought to pervert to an English party use — to the mean purposes of their own bid for place and power in England — the armed activities of simple Irishmen. We aimed at winning the Ulster Volunteers to the cause of a United Ireland. We aimed at uniting all Irishmen in a natural and national bond of cohesion based on mutual self-respect. Our hope was a natural one, and if left to ourselves, not hard to accomplish. If external influences of disintegration would but leave us alone, we were sure that Nature itself must bring us together. It was not we, the Irish Volunteers, who broke the law, but a British party. The Government had permitted the Ulster Volunteers to be armed by Englishmen, to threaten not merely an English party in its hold on office, but to threaten that party through the lives and blood of Irishmen.</p>
<p>The battle was to be fought in Ireland in order that the political &lsquo;outs&rsquo; of to-day should be the &lsquo;ins&rsquo; of to-morrow in Great Britain. A law designed for the benefit of Ireland was to be met, not on the floor of Parliament, where the fight had indeed been won, but on the field of battle much nearer home, where the armies would be composed of Irishmen slaying each other for some English party gain; and the British Navy would be the chartered &rsquo;transports&rsquo; that were to bring to our shores a numerous assemblage of military and ex-military experts in the congenial and profitable exercise of holding down subject populations abroad. Our choice lay in submitting to foreign lawlessness or resisting it, and we did not hesitate to choose. But while the law-breakers had armed their would-be agents openly, and had been permitted to arm them openly, we were met within a few days of founding of our movement — that aimed at a United Ireland from within — by Government action from without, directed against our obtaining any arms at all.</p>
<p>The Manifesto of the Irish Volunteers, promulgated at a public meeting in Dublin, November 25th 1913, stated with certainty the aims of the organisation, as I have outlined them. If the aims set out in that manifesto were a threat to the unity of the British Empire, then so much the worse for the Empire. An Empire that can only be held together by one section of its governing population perpetually holding down and sowing dissension among a smaller but none-the-less governing section, must have some canker at its heart, some ruin at its root. The Government that permitted the arming of those whose leaders declared that Irish national unity was a thing that should be opposed by force of arms, within nine days of the issue of our manifesto of good-will to Irishmen of every creed and class, took steps to nullify our efforts by prohibiting the import of arms into Ireland as if it had been a hostile and blockaded coast. And this Proclamation of the 4th December 1913, known as the Arms Proclamation, was itself based on an illegal interpretation of the law, as the Chief Secretary has now publicly confessed. The Proclamation was met by the loyalists of Great Britain with an act of still more lawless defiance — an act of widespread gun-running into Ulster, that was denounced by the Lord Chancellor of England as &lsquo;grossly illegal and utterly unconstitutional&rsquo;.</p>
<p>How did the Irish Volunteers meet the incitements to civil war that were uttered by the party of law and order in England? I can answer for my own acts and speeches. While one English party was responsible for preaching a doctrine of hatred, designed to bring about civil war in Ireland, the other, and that the party in power, took no active steps to restrain a propaganda that found its advocates in the Army, Navy, and Privy Council — in the House of Parliament and in the State Church — a propaganda the methods of whose expression were so &lsquo;grossly illegal and utterly unconstitutional&rsquo; that even the Lord Chancellor of England could find only words and no repressive action to apply to them. Since lawlessness sat in high places in England and laughed at the law as at the custodians of the law, what wonder was it that Irishmen should refuse to accept the verbal protestations of an English Lord Chancellor as a sufficient safeguard for their lives and liberties? I know not how all my colleagues on the Volunteer Committee in Dublin reviewed the growing menace, but those with whom I was in closest cooperation redoubled, in face of these threats from without, our efforts to unite all Irishmen from within. Our appeals were made to Protestant and Unionist as much almost as to Catholic and Nationalist Irishmen. We hoped that, by the exhibition of affection and goodwill on our part toward our political opponents in Ireland, we should yet succeed in winning them from the side of an English party whose sole interest in our country lay in its oppression in the past, and in the present in its degradation to the mean and narrow needs of their political animosities.</p>
<p>It is true that they based their actions — so they averred — on &lsquo;fears for the empire&rsquo; and on a very diffuse loyalty that took in all the peoples of the empire, save only the Irish. That blessed word empire that bears so paradoxical resemblance to charity! For if charity begins at home, empire begins in other men&rsquo;s homes, and both may cover a multitude of sins. I, for one, was determined that Ireland was much more to me than empire, and, if charity begins at home, so must loyalty. Since arms were so necessary to make our organization a reality, and to give to the minds of Irishmen, menaced with the most outrageous threats, a sense of security, it was our bounden duty to get arms before all else. I decided, with this end in view, to go to America, with surely a better right to appeal to Irishmen there for help in an hour of great national trial, than those envoys of empire could assert for their weekend descents on Ireland, or their appeals to Germany.</p>
<p>If, as the right honourable gentleman, the present Attorney-General, asserted in a speech at Manchester, Nationalists would neither fight for Home Rule nor pay for it, it was our duty to show him that we knew how to do both. Within a few weeks of my arrival in the United States, the fund that had been opened to secure arms for the Volunteers of Ireland amounted to many thousands of pounds. In every case the money subscribed, whether it came from the purse of the wealthy man, or from the still readier pocket of the poor man, was Irish gold.</p>
<p>Then came the war! — which, as Mr Birrell said, &lsquo;upset all calculations&rsquo;. It upset mine no less than Mr Birrell&rsquo;s, and put an end to my peaceful effort in America. A constitutional movement in Ireland is never very far from a breach of the constitution, as the loyalists of Ulster have been so eager to show us. A constitution, to be maintained intact, must be the achievement and the pride of the people themselves, must rest on their own free will and on their own determination to maintain it, instead of being something resident in another land, whose chief representative is an armed force — armed not to protect the population, but to hold it down. We had seen the workings of &rsquo;the Irish Constitution&rsquo; in the refusal of the Army of Occupation at the Curragh to obey the orders of the Crown. And now that we were told the first duty of an Irishman was to enter that army, in return for a promissory note, payable after death — a scrap of paper that might or might not be redeemed — I felt, over there in America, that my first duty was to keep Irishmen at home in the only army that could safeguard our national existence. If small nationalities were to be the pawns in this game of embattled giants, I saw no reason why Ireland should shed her blood in any cause but her own, and, if that be treason beyond the seas, I am not ashamed to avow it, or to answer for it here with my life. And when we had the doctrine of Unionist loyalty at last — &lsquo;Mausers and Kaisers, and any king you like&rsquo;, and I have heard that at Hamburg, nor far from Limburg on the Lahn — I felt that I needed no other than that these words conveyed, to go forth and do likewise.</p>
<p>The difference between us was that the Unionist champions chose a path which they felt would lead to the woolsack, while I went a road I knew must lead to the dock. The difference between us was that my &rsquo;treason&rsquo; was based on a ruthless sincerity that forced me to attempt in time and season to carry out in action what I said in words, whereas their treason lay in verbal incitements that they knew would never be made good in their bodies. And so I am prouder to stand here to-day, in the traitor&rsquo;s dock, to answer this impeachment, than to fill the place of my right honourable accusers.</p>
<p>We have been told, we have been asked to hope, that after this war Ireland will get Home Rule as a reward for the lifeblood shed in a cause which, whomever else its success may benefit, can surely not benefit Ireland. And what will Home Rule be in return for what its vague promise has taken, and still hopes to take away from Ireland? It is not necessary to climb the painful stairs of Irish history — that treadmill of a nation, whose labours are as vain for her own uplifting as the convict&rsquo;s exertions are for his redemption, to review the long list of British promises made only to be broken — of Irish hopes, raised only to be dashed to the ground. Home Rule, when it comes, if come it does, will find an Ireland drained of all that is vital to its very existence unless it be that unquenchable hope we build on the graves of the dead.</p>
<p>We are told that if Irishmen go by the thousand to die, not for Ireland, but for Flanders, for Belgium, for a patch of sand in the deserts of Mesopotamia, or a rocky trench on the heights of Gallipoli, they are winning self-government for Ireland. But if they dare to lay down their lives on their native soil, if they dare to dream even that freedom can be won only at home by men resolved to fight for it there, then they are traitors to their country, and their dream and their deaths are phases of a dishonourable phantasy.</p>
<p>But history is not so recorded in other lands. In Ireland alone, in this twentieth century, is loyalty held to be a crime. If loyalty be something less than love and more than law, then we have had enough of such loyalty for Ireland or Irishmen. If we are to be indicted as criminals, to be shot as murderers, to be imprisoned as convicts, because our offence is that we love Ireland more than we value our lives, then I do not know what virtue resides in any offer of self-government held out to brave men on such terms. Self-government is our right, a thing born in us at birth, a thing no more to be doled out to us, or withheld from us, by another people than the right to life itself — than the right to feel the sun, or smell the flowers, or to love our kind. It is only from the convict these things are withheld, for crime committed and proven, and Ireland, that has wronged no man, has injured no land, that has sought no dominion over others — Ireland is being treated today among the nations of the world as if she were a convicted criminal.</p>
<p>If it be treason to fight against such an unnatural fate as this, then I am proud to be a rebel, and shall cling to my &lsquo;rebellion&rsquo; with the last drop of my blood. If there be no right of rebellion against this state of things that no savage tribe would endure without resistance, then I am sure that it is better for men to fight and die without right than to live in such a state as this. Where all your rights have become only an accumulated wrong, where men must beg with bated breath for leave to subsist in their own land, to think their own thoughts, to sing their own songs, to gather the fruits of their own labours, and, even while they beg, to see things inexorably withdrawn from them — then, surely, it is a braver, a saner and truer thing to be a rebel, in act and in deed, against such circumstances as these, than to tamely accept it, as the natural lot of men.</p>
<p>My lord, I have done. Gentlemen of the jury, I wish to thank you for your verdict. I hope you will not take amiss what I said, or think that I made any imputation upon your truthfulness or your integrity when I spoke and said that this was not a trial by my peers. I maintain that I have a natural right to be tried in that natural jurisdiction, Ireland, my own country, and I would put it to you, how would you feel in the converse case, or rather how would all men here feel in the converse case — if an Englishman had landed here in England and the Crown or the Government, for its own purposes, had conveyed him secretly from England to Ireland under a false name, committed him to prison under a false name, and brought him before a tribunal in Ireland under a statute which they knew involved a trial before an Irish jury? How would you feel, yourselves, as Englishmen if that Englishman was to be submitted to trial by jury in a land inflamed against him and believing him to be a criminal, when his only crime was that he had cared for England more than for Ireland?</p>

			<description>On 21 April 1916 a German submarine put Roger Casement ashore at Banna Strand in Tralee Bay, County Kerry. For his efforts to procure German arms for the Easter Rising, which would take place three days later, he was arrested on charges of high treason, sabotage and espionage against the Crown.
Casement&amp;rsquo;s trial opened at the Royal Courts of Justice on 26 June 1916. He was found guilty and hanged, one of sixteen Irish men executed in the immediate aftermath of the Rising for their attempts to free their country from the most powerful Empire on the face of the earth.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>On 21 April 1916 a German submarine put Roger Casement ashore at Banna Strand in Tralee Bay, County Kerry. For his efforts to procure German arms for the Easter Rising, which would take place three days later, he was arrested on charges of high treason, sabotage and espionage against the Crown.</em></p>
<p><em>Casement&rsquo;s trial opened at the Royal Courts of Justice on 26 June 1916. He was found guilty and hanged, one of sixteen Irish men executed in the immediate aftermath of the Rising for their attempts to free their country from the most powerful Empire on the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><em>The Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, recommended to Casement that he abandon a traditional legal defense, appeal directly to the jury on the basis of Ireland&rsquo;s claim to sovereign nationhood, and wrote a speech for him to this end. Casement did not adopt the strategy and Shaw&rsquo;s speech was not delivered in the course of the case. As I can&rsquo;t find it the text of it anywhere online, I&rsquo;ve transcribed it. It appears here, any edits are those present in the source and are not my own.</em></p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury I plead not guilty to the charge of high treason.  But I ask you not to take this as a denial of the essential facts relied on by the Crown. What I deny rather, is that any guilt attaches to those facts. I have spared you the tedium of calling witnesses to prove facts which I do not dispute, and of which I am not ashamed. Indeed, rather than seeking to repudiate the Crown’s case, I embrace it.</p>
<p>It is quite true that I made up my mind that my country ought to achieve her independence of English rule by force of arms. I hope that, in a very humble way, I might do for my country what Garibaldi has been honoured in England for doing for his country, Italy. You may smile at my vanity now that I have failed, but you know that nations are not freed by personal modesty any more than by personal vanity, and a nation which cannot produce a Garibaldi has to be content with Roger Casements. And the Casements, must do their best.</p>
<p>I concluded, that it was no more possible for Ireland to free herself without foreign alliances than it had been possible for Italy to free herself without the help of France. I sought to obtain the assistance of the German Empire in this enterprise. I have no apology whatever to make for that. It was my plain duty to my country. I did not want German troops in Ireland. What I wanted from Germany was money, munitions and Irish soldiers, and this was all accepted. The German authorities collected their Irish prisoners and invited me to persuade them to take part in my enterprise. I did my best. I need hardly say I did not ask any English soldier to fight against his own country. I know how to respect other peoples’ nationality because I know how to respect my own.</p>
<p>An attempt has been made to prejudice me on the ground that I was formally in the pay of the British Empire and that I was knighted for my services to it. I am glad of that now, because the fact that I served England well enough to have my services publicly acknowledged and especially rewarded, shows that I have no quarrel with England except the political quarrel which England respects and applauds in Italy, Poland, Belgium and in short, in every country except those conquered and denationalised by England herself. Almost all the disasters and difficulties that have made the relations of Ireland with England so mischievous to both countries have arisen from the failure of England to understand Ireland is not a province of England, but a nation, and to negotiate with her on that assumption. If you persist in treating me as an Englishman you bind yourself thereby to hang me as a traitor before the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>Now, as a simple matter of fact I am neither an Englishman, nor a traitor. I am an Irishman, captured in a fair attempt to achieve the independence of my country, and you can no more deprive me of the honours of that position or destroy the effects of my effort than the abominable cruelties inflicted 600 years ago on William Wallace in this city when he met a precisely similar indictment with a precisely similar reply, have prevented that brave and honourable Scot from becoming the national hero his country.</p>
<p>It may seem to some of you gentlemen of the jury that I ought not to be hanged for being a traitor; I ought to be hanged for being a fool. I will not plead that if men are to be hanged for errors of judgement in politics we should have such a mortality in England and Ireland that hardly one of us will be left to hang the other. But I may ask you, if you nevertheless lean to that opinion on my case, whether my attempt, desperate as it seems, has been after all, so disastrous a failure. I am not trying to shirk the British scaffold; it has been the altar which the Irish saints have been canonised for centuries but I confess, I shrink a little from the pillory in which the public opinion of the word places man who, with the best of intentions, can do nothing but mischief to the cause they embrace. But I do not think I shall occupy that pillory.</p>
<p>Will you understand me when I say that those days of splendid fighting against desperate odds on the streets of Dublin have given Ireland back her self-respect? We were beaten, indeed, never had a dog’s chance of victory, but you were also beaten, in a no less rash and desperate enterprise, in Gallipoli. Are you ashamed of it? Did your hearts burn any less? Did your faith in the valour of your race flag and falter because you were at last driven into the sea by the Turks? Well, what you feel about the fight in Gallipoli, Irishmen feel all over the world about the fight in Dublin. Even if it had no further consequences, even if it had not sent your prime minister, who had shelved the Home Rule act as if it had been a negligible parish by-law, scuttling to Dublin, I should still glory in the feat of arms.</p>
<p>And now gentlemen, you may hang me, if you like. I will not even add: <em>and be damned to you</em>, because I feel no more ill will to you than I did in the days when you were glad enough to claim my public work, as the work of an English consul. You have no immediate vengeance to fear for it. It cannot be said that you dare not kill me; I hope that my countrymen, whatever happens, will not waste their energy and degrade their souls with idle dreams of vengeance, even if the fortune of war should make it possible for them to give effect to them. My neck is at your mercy, if it amuses you to break it. My honour and reputation are beyond your reach.</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice will presently tell you, I could anticipate the inevitable summing up for you if I doubted his ability to express it far more weightily than I, he will tell you, as he must, that legally I am a traitor. But history, will not, on that account, absolve you from the most sacred duty of a jury. The duty of standing at the side of right, truth and justice between all honest laymen, and that part of the law, which was made against their own consent, to destroy them. The question for you is not whether I have broken this law or that, nor whether what I have done comes under this or that legal classification. The question for you is whether I am guilty, or not guilty, and if you allow any judicial direction to distract you from that issue, you will betray not only me — your political enemy — but every man alive who has nothing but a jury between him and the worst that the dead letter of unjust laws can do to him.</p>
<p>I hope that I have spoken here today as you would desire an Englishmen speak in a German court if your country shared the fate of mine. I ask for no mercy, no pardon, no pity. I sincerely and humbly beg your pardon if at any moment during this trial my inextinguishable pride in being an Irishman and my exaltation in the bravery and devotion of my countrymen has betrayed me into an exhibition of vanity or arrogance. Of any trace of malice I know I am entirely free, for I feel none, and shall feel none. Whatever the upshot may be gentlemen, I have done my duty. Now, it is your turn.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Scott, Peter Dale. Deep Politics and the Death of JFK. University of California Press, 1996.</em></p>
<p><em>4</em> The Warren Report&rsquo;s representation of Jack Ruby as a loner was clearly false; the FBI went to great lengths to conceal Ruby&rsquo;s connections to organised crime.</p>
<p><em>38</em> On November 25 1963, in advance of the Warren Commission being established, its conclusions were published in an AP wire story:</p>
<p>&lsquo;FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said today all available information indicates that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When an FBI assistant director objected that this could not be determined at such an early stage Hoover responded: &lsquo;It seems to me we have the basic facts now&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On November 29 Hoover stated in a memo that the investigation would be wrapped up quickly after a Mexican lead have been pursued.</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s argument is that this first cover-up was a false but plausible story of an international communist conspiracy which would be supported by superficially credible evidence but this was later changed to &lsquo;Oswald as lone gunman&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>39</em> The most robust piece of evidence undergirding the communist conspiracy story is a pre-assassination cable to CIA Director McCone on October 9 1963 from Winston MacKinlay Scott, a CIA station chief in Mexico City, which referred to an American male identifying himself in broken Russian as Lee Oswald at the Soviet Embassy on 28 September asking a Consul he believed to be Vladimirovich Kostikov if there was anything new re: telegram to Washington.</p>
<p>Kostikov had been identified by the CIA and FBI as a member fo the KGB&rsquo;s Thirteenth Department: responsible for sabotage, murder and potentially the operator of a training school for assassins in Minsk, where Oswald had lived from 1959 - 61 as a defector.</p>
<p>Just before the assassination the FBI intercepted a letter to the Soviet Embassy dated November 9 1963 supposedly signed by Oswald referring to &lsquo;my meetings with comrade Kostin in the Embassy of the Soviet Union&hellip;had I been able to reach the Soviet Embassy in Havana as planned, the embassy there would have had time to complete our business&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>44</em> The FBI assisted the CIA in concealing information or not following up on leads or interviewing witnesses; the FBI vetoed the collection of testimony from John Wilson Hudson and was pro-active in propagating the premature finding that Oswald was the lone assassin.</p>
<p><em>49</em> Bill Somersett, an informant for the Miami police, recorded Joseph Adams Milteer, a man with connections to the Ku Klux Klan and an organiser for the National States Rights Party, on tape in November 1963 about plans which were &lsquo;in the working&rsquo; to assassinate JFK &lsquo;from an office building with a high powered rifle&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Southern racists were organising around this time to defy federal orders for desegregation. A Miami detective&rsquo;s report of the New Orleans Congress of Freedom, Inc. records &rsquo;there was indicated the overthrow of the present government&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>50</em> High ranking members of the armed forces were members of this organisation; there were significant amounts of resentment within the army, e.g. General Edwin Walker, who was forced to retire from the army in 1962 for disseminating right-wing propaganda inside the army; Walker was arrested at a desegregation riot at the University of Mississippi that same year.</p>
<p>Four days after the assassination Milteer was jubilant and was adamant his foreknowledge was not a coincidence; in two FBI reports from Miami Somersett is described as a reliable source, but the FBI demanded that this reliability statement be amended.</p>
<p><em>55</em> Charles Douglas Jackson, a CIA specialist in psychological operations also worked as the publisher of <em>Life</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Jackson was responsible for <em>Life</em>&rsquo;s purchase of the rights to the Zapruder film and allegedly stopped <em>Life</em>&rsquo;s presses to alter the selection of frames to be published from the film.</p>
<p>Alan Foster Dulles - Director of the CIA until JFK forced him out in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs operation - and Jackson together arranged to have Marina&rsquo;s CIA veteran Isaac Don Levine ghost-write Marina Oswald&rsquo;s article for <em>Life</em>, a detail which was covered up by the Warren Commission.</p>
<p><em>58</em> The Warren Report describes a man who met Oswald on his return from Russia as &lsquo;a representative of the Traveler&rsquo;s Aid Society&rsquo;, a human services support system facilitating interactions between individuals at transit hubs.</p>
<p>What the Warren Report doesn&rsquo;t mention is that this man, Spas T. Raikin was a Bulgarian émigré and Secretary-General of the American Friends of the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations.</p>
<p>In 1964, when Robert Kennedy was the Attorney General, the Justice Department compiled an index for the Warren Commission staff of all of Jack Ruby&rsquo;s acquaintances who had been interviewed by the FBI before February 4 1964.</p>
<p>Around 100 names were missing from this index, all of whom pertained to interviews the FBI conducted with figures from organised crime or corrupt political backgrounds.</p>
<p><em>61</em> The House Committee noted that the Warren Commission&rsquo;s representation of Ruby as a loner were faulty.</p>
<p>While the House Committee found that Ruby&rsquo;s connections with the organised crime world were mentioned in reports received by the FBI in the weeks following Oswald&rsquo;s shootings, the FBI had not followed up on these connections; Mafia specialists or organised crime units were not consulted to asked to participate to any significant extent.</p>
<p><em>62</em> Agent William Sullivan was later disciplined by Hoover for what the Inspection Division determined was a lax investigation of Oswald prior to the assassination; within Sullivan&rsquo;s Domestic Intelligence Division, the investigation of Oswald was assigned to a team of agents from the Bureau&rsquo;s Soviet section.</p>
<p>While there were numerous experts on Cuban activities and émigré activity within these divisions, none were consulted or asked to participate in the investigation, despite Oswald and Ruby&rsquo;s connections with individuals active in Cuban anti-communist circles.</p>
<p>This was a problem for Sullivan&rsquo;s Intelligence Division due to the Kostikov cable and Oswald&rsquo;s letter to the Soviet embassy.</p>
<p><em>63</em> Inspector James H. Gale, who J. Edgar Hoover assigned  to review the Bureau&rsquo;s handling of Oswald, said that Oswald should have been placed on a Security Index after the Kostikov cable and his application for a passport denied; the FBI advised the Warren Commission that the cable would not have warranted this rejection.</p>
<p><em>64</em> Hoover placed the investigation of Oswald in the hands of Alan Belmont, William Sullivan and William Branigan, all of whom had responsibility for COINTELPRO, a counterintelligence program focused on discrediting and neutralising organisations the FBI regarded as subversive, including the Communist Party, anti-war organisations, civil rights activists and Black power parties.</p>
<p><em>65 - 6</em> Belmont and Branigan had collaborated in the murder of the Rosenbergs; a compliant witness, who had earlier testified that Ethel was not involved was &lsquo;reinterviewed&rsquo; for 400 hours until the necessary incrimination was secured.</p>
<p><em>69</em> Scott points out that the House Committee, like the Warren Commission, was unable to secure full co-operation from the FBI or the CIA; Justice Department officials were similarly obstructive and sometimes hostile.</p>
<p>Its findings that there was a probable conspiracy to shoot the President with &lsquo;a high probability that two gunmen fired at him&rsquo; was widely derided and denounced by <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>However, the House Committee continued to perpetuate the cover-up of the Warren Report, especially in regard to Jack Ruby&rsquo;s connections with law enforcement, politicians and businessmen, even with the Warren Report&rsquo;s Committee producing a report entitled: &lsquo;Possible Associations Between Jack Ruby and Organised Crime&rsquo;, which ran to 1,044 pages.</p>
<p><em>70</em> According to his lawyer, Ruby was an informer for the Kefauver Senate Special Committee investigating crime in interstate commerce; in return for his testimony they agreed to ignore police corruption in Dallas, specifically with regard to criminal takeover of the national wire racing service.</p>
<p>This takeover was a key piece of infrastructure in organising criminal activity, including drug trafficking. Money arising from these operations was reinvested in international hotels, defense industries which formed crucial parts of the US&rsquo; growing military-industrial establishment.</p>
<p>Scott argues Ruby was involved in major drug trafficking operations but was protected from arrest as he was a police informant with connections with judges and other powerful figures within the Dallas political establishment.</p>
<p><em>73</em> An important figure here is Clint Murchison, Sr., who made his money from the Teamsters&rsquo; Pension Fund, dominated by the Mafia and shipping heroin / cocaine to the US.</p>
<p><em>78</em> Oswald was stationed with the Marine from 1957 - 8, his Marine Air Control Squadron was assigned to a station at Atsugi in Japan, one of the major bases for the CIA&rsquo;s U-2 reconnaissance flights over the USSR.</p>
<p>He was part of Operation Strongback, a military task force backing a 1958 attempt to overthrow Sukarno. His apparent defection to the USSR in 1959 was part of a wave of defections by men with backgrounds in intelligence; Scott argues this was a US operation to penetrate the USSR.</p>
<p>On his return to Dallas in 1962 Oswald maintained connections with the intelligence world and did classified work for the US army at the graphic arts company Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall.</p>
<p>This job was arranged by Baron George de Mohrenschildt, a spy during World War II, who seems to have been involved with a CIA-approved plot who overthrow Francois &lsquo;Papa Doc&rsquo; Duvalier; de Mohrenschildt was introduced to the Oswalds by J. Walton Moore, a CIA employee.</p>
<p><em>80</em> It is increasingly clear that Oswald&rsquo;s activism as a Castro sympathiser, distributing Fair Play for Cuba Committee literature, functioned as a smoke-screen; this literature was stamped with the address of an anti-Castro activities committee headed by a militant anti-Communist Guy Banister.</p>
<p><em>81</em> Three witnesses interviewed by the House Committee placed Oswald in Banister&rsquo;s presence at this address.</p>
<p>Oswald was in contact with at least five anti-Castro Cuban members of the CIA-backed Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), which had up until late 1962 been housed in the same building and was also connected with Banister.</p>
<p>Carlos Bringuier, a former member of the CRC, had a street scuffle with Oswald; Oswald was the only party fined for his involvement.</p>
<p>Bringuier arranged for local news TV cameras to be present at the court hearing, when Oswald and a number of CRC Cubans engaged in a shouting match.</p>
<p>Bringuier&rsquo;s colleagues arranged a debate betweeen Bringuier and Oswald on the radio at which Oswald declared himself a Marxist.</p>
<p><em>82</em> Oswald&rsquo;s bail was paid by Emile Bruneau, a state boxing commissioner and friend of Oswald&rsquo;s uncle Dutz Murret, who had ties to the mafia.</p>
<p><em>83 - 4</em> Oswald appeared on the TB and raido a number of times, on one such occasion he was filmed leafletting for the FPCC in New Orleans where he hired Charles Hall Steele Jr. to help ; the Warren Commission said he did so for 12 to 15 minutes, an FBI report said a few moments; TV cameras filmed this event after receiving a call from Oswald.</p>
<p><em>93</em> Many senior figures in the Cuban exile and anti-communist organisations had connections with in United Fruit and Standard Fruit &amp; Steamship, companies with material interests in preventing Communist regimes from coming to power in Central and South America.</p>
<p>Two men working with these companies were in contact with Oswald while he was at the peak of his political activism in New Orleans.</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of tension between these companies and the Kennedy administration&rsquo;s preference for democratically elected governments in the region. [citation needed]</p>
<p>The banana firms supported a coup against Honduran president Ramón Villeda Morales, which began by U.S. trained army pilots attacking the presidential palace.</p>
<p><em>94</em> Kennedy refused to recognise the new Honduran government of General Oswaldo López Arellano; President Johnson&rsquo;s undersecretary of state for Latin American affairs, Thomas Mann, was involved in planning the coup, granted recognition in December 1963.</p>
<p>Manuel Gil, who had arranged for the televised broadcast of the Oswald-Bringuier debate, was an employee of Standard Fruit. He was also an association of the Information Council of the Americas, a joint CIA and Standard Fruit front based in New Orleans.</p>
<p><em>102</em> Fruit companies in New Orleans did much to create the client regimes of Latin America; gangsters based in New Orleans organised the 1911 Honduran revolution that led to the ascendancy of European bankers and bondholders.</p>
<p><em>108</em> Across the world the anti-communist policies and actions of the US state apparatus, including the CIA and the military upheld the interests of US multinational companies, such as oil companies and ITT.</p>
<p>While in Europe these activities were often more subtle, in Latin America US agents had freer hands; Rip Robertson, a Marine Corps officer was fired by the CIA for authorising one of his pilots to drop a bomb down the smokestack of a British cargo carrier.</p>
<p><em>111</em> John Martino and a man named John Rosselli had been centrally involved with the CIA in overthrowing the democratically elected government in Guatemala in 1954.</p>
<p>After the Bay of Pigs and Martino&rsquo;s release from prison in Havana, he and Rosselli moved to Florida to organise Cuban-exile resistance.</p>
<p><em>116</em> In doing so they forged connections with personnel in Lake Pontchartrain, where the CIA operated a base for training anti-Castro Cuban exiles.</p>
<p>Both Martino and Rosselli were convinced Castro was behind the assassination of JFK.</p>
<p>This represented a problem for more senior figures in intelligence circles such as Jackson and CIA operative William Pawley, as they had worked with Martino in a separate operation to undermine Kennedy&rsquo;s Cuban-missile-crisis-settlement by seeking to expose supposed offensive weapon capacities in Cuba.</p>
<p>According to Loran Hall, another anti-Castro activist, the real objective of this mission was to assassinate Castro and collect a bounty the Mafia had put on his head.</p>
<p><em>117</em> Both Martino and Rosselli met Jack Ruby and worked with him in Havana in 1959 when they were smuggling casino profits out to the US.</p>
<p>The House Committee concluded that Ruby was most likely serving as a middleman for gambling interests.</p>
<p><em>127</em> One of the most misleading aspects of the Warren Report was its insistence that Ruby had no connections to the world of organised crime; Ruby was in fact deeply integrated into a broad section of Dallas society including politicians, cops, judges, traffickers, prostitutes.</p>
<p><em>128</em> This section of the Warren Report required extensive re-writing in order to downplay these connections, some witnesses were ignored, statements were edited.</p>
<p><em>137</em> In 1959 the FBI developed Ruby as a informant and reimbursed him for expenses.</p>
<p><em>164 - 6</em> The CIA collaborated with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to utilise drug trafficking networks to fund the activities of anti-communist organisations and paramilitaries. [Gary Webb writes on this]</p>
<p><em>167</em> Offers the example of a heroin trafficking with the assistant of the anti-Communist and pro-Kuomintang Hip Sing tong gang, at a time when KMT guerillas were being supported by the CIA in Burma; the US press was told the heroin had come from Communist China.</p>
<p><em>173</em> Union leader Jimmy Hoffa, with the assistance of the Justice Department, cops and the FBI led a number of campaigns against communists in a rival union which had defected to the more militant CIO; Hoffa was promoted to national leadership off the back of this campaign which also brought him into closer connection with mob elements in Chicago and a Waste Handler&rsquo;s Union in which Ruby headed a local.</p>
<p><em>174</em> The Teamsters were also involved in trafficking operations, an alliance which was initiated when the US government released a number of Mafia figures from prison and deported them to Sicily where they acted as an anti-Communist militia to help elect the CIA-favoured Christian Democratic party.</p>
<p>Hoffa&rsquo;s first mob contact Frank Coppola, the godfather of Hoffa&rsquo;s foster son Chuck O&rsquo;Brien, was involved in a May Day massacre in Sicily in 1947, funded by former OSS chief William Donovan in which eight people were killed and 33 wounded.</p>
<p>498 people, mostly socialists and communists were killed the following year.</p>
<p>Former CIA officer Miles Copeland defended these operations in 1989: &lsquo;had it not been for the Mafia the communists would by now be in control of Italy&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>242</em> Rather than conduct their own investigation, the Warren Commission allowed the FBI and CIA to investigate themselves.</p>
<p><em>243</em> Dallas district attorney Henry Wade and Texas Attorney General Waggoner Carr testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald was an FBI informant; he had a federal government voucher for $200 at the time of his arrest and FBI agent James Hosty&rsquo;s name and phone number was in his address book.</p>
<p><em>245</em> In 1962 Oswald was able to get a job at a firm doing classified work for the Army Security Agency where he professed communist sympathies and retained complete access to classified FBI documents.</p>
<p><em>295</em> At the first meeting of the Warren Commission Allen Dulles handed out copies of a book which defined the parameters for the Commission&rsquo;s work, arguing that European assassinations were different from American ones; European assassins worked in conspiracies, American assassins acted alone.</p>

			<description>A note on terminology: Nairn uses the term &amp;lsquo;Protestants&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;unionists&amp;rsquo; and Ulster rather than &amp;rsquo;the six counties&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Ulster&amp;rsquo;
In the opening paragraphs of &amp;lsquo;Northern Ireland: Portent or Relic&amp;rsquo;, a chapter written on Ireland in The Break-up of Britain (1977), Tom Nairn outlines his understanding of the Troubles.

It is separate from the English government, which has no interest in the region, whether strategic, political or ideological.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>A note on terminology: Nairn uses the term &lsquo;Protestants&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;unionists&rsquo; and Ulster rather than &rsquo;the six counties&rsquo; as &lsquo;Ulster&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>In the opening paragraphs of &lsquo;Northern Ireland: Portent or Relic&rsquo;, a chapter written on Ireland in <em>The Break-up of Britain</em> (1977), Tom Nairn outlines his understanding of the Troubles. From his point of view it is a conflict taking place between two communities. It is separate from the English government, which has no interest in the region, whether strategic, political or ideological.</p>
<p>This is not an analysis that coincides with the facts. Successive British governments, whether Labour and Conservative, directed their army, their intelligence services and loyal subjects to enthusiastically support those in the six counties who wished to remain within the Union. This support took the form of arms, training for loyalist paramilitaries, a uniquely brutal police force, targeted assassinations of prominent members in the nationalist community, conspiring against figures in Leinster House they regarded as sympathetic to the cause of unification, as well as bombing Dublin and Monaghan.</p>
<p>In Nairn&rsquo;s account of Ireland&rsquo;s underdevelopment there is a surfeit of pub talk, about how it gave up the crown for the Holy Ghost and a deficit of material on how this might have something to do with the Saorstát remaining an imperial formation after <em>Cogadh na Saoirse</em>, remaining bound by the terms of the so-called Anglo-Irish Treaty,  and a bourgeoisie with a material interest in maintaining social and economic continuity - or more latterly integration into a world market dominated by the United States - in power. In contrast with the underdeveloped Saorstát, which Nairn encapsulates as &rsquo;the priest and the potato&rsquo;, the six counties are highly industrialised. The unionist working class are riding the rise of an advanced capitalist order and their demands are <em>de facto</em> progressive and modern.</p>
<p>In this way Nairn dismisses the idea that the situation in the six counties is a colonial one, the 1920 Government of Ireland act was the merely legislated for what was an accomplished fact of distinct developmental regimes. Marxists who argue that this was an attempt to stymie Irish independence are putting forward a simplistic, conspiratorial and &lsquo;pseudo-Marxist&rsquo; account. Cutting this anti-imperialist analysis at its root is crucial for Nairn&rsquo;s model because it would represent the his authentically progressive actors, &rsquo;the largest proletariat in (geographical) Ireland&rsquo;,  them as lackeys of British imperialism. The likes of Eamon McCann, the Official IRA and People&rsquo;s Democracy whose programmes advocate, with varying degrees of ingenuousness, for a coming together of unionist and nationalist on the basis of a shared class interest, are beholden to a cult of martyrdom surrounding James Connolly, citing the clowncar of Conor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien and the British and Irish Communist Organisation to this effect.</p>
<p>Nairn of course is incorrect here. The six-counties do not align with the historical nine-county province because the garrison state would be unsustainable were it to include the significant nationalist populations of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan. That this was a pragmatic decision is further evinced by unionist leaders speculating during the long war that restive parts of South Armagh could be traded with the Saorstát for more scenic parts of Donegal. For Nairn the only form of imperialism that exists today are capital investments from metropolian or core countries, which have, we are told, an interest in abolishing borders and eliminating racial dominance as well as ethnic feuds. Nairn of course never tells us what countries these multi-nationals are based in because this would require him to admit that they are not nationless entities falling out of the sky, but rather arise out of nations with a history of grinding others beneath the yoke.</p>
<p>However there are points at which Nairn is at pains to square this rubric with the evidence. Nairns wants to celebrate the 1974 Ulster Worker&rsquo;s Council Strike, &lsquo;without doubt the most successful political action carried out by any European working class since the World War&rsquo;, but this requires him to pass over the fact that this strike was a reaction at the idea that the nationalist population should have even a modicum of involvement in running of the statelet in which they found themselves. Nairn is also frustrated at the many ways in which his world-historical progressive force is in many ways wholly regressive. This makes it necessary for Nairn to frame their seventeeth-century anti-Catholicism, or the cross-class nature of unionism, which even he concedes has a lot in common with white Rhodesians and the <em>pieds noirs</em> as a bizarre aberration and nothing to do with the ideological core of this group, a rejection of the native Irish against which they define themselves, a clear-cut case of settler colonial ideology. What he offers by way of an alternative explanation is a useless series of riffs about how unionists feel and behave, without bringing into the picture their particular class composition, their specific relationship with multinational capital, what kinds of industry are present in the six counties, how Catholics relate to these, whether or not being chased out of shipyards might have something to do with Catholics being under-represented in the largest proletariat on the island. When it comes to Ireland, Nairn was strictly vibes only, preferring to throw around references to bowler hats and Finn MacCool as if this was acceptable.</p>
<p>Not only is granting unionists their own nation the only way to break them from their religiously-inspired racism, but socialists who do not agree with Nairn are moralising philistines, in a long-tradition of moralising philistinism  all the way back to Marx and Engels who granted the right of self-determination in some contexts, but withdrew it in others. As Marx and Engels knew, the national question could not be viewed separately from the confrontation with imperialism. Self-determination is about wounding the vampire squid in as many places as you can, to strengthen leverage against it at all points. If socialist organisations demand self-determination in some contexts while granting it in others we could look at the reasons why. Interested groups demanding extra-territorial claims into the bargain maybe. A history of expropriation and / or genocide, paramilitary violence. Crimes against humanity. Or perhaps the Marxists are wrong and once Lenin got into power he should have allowed Germany to annex as much territory as they wanted.</p>
<p>That Nairn can, refer to a &rsquo;long British tradition of relucant, last-minute intervention in Irish affairs&rsquo; in a sentence about the activity of the British government in Ireland in 1972 about sums it up. Nairn set out to write a book about Britain. In his section on England&rsquo;s first colony, the key to understanding everything that has happened since, he has revealed himself to not only lack the most basic command over the materials, but has split his model apart in trying to fit the evidence. He then spends forty pages moping over the pieces. Anyone who presents this book as a guide for the Union over the next number of decades is proudly announcing their intention to charge down a blind alley.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><em>12</em> The Ottomans officially surrendered to the British inside Jerusalem&rsquo;s walled Old City on 9 December 1917.</p>
<p>This ended four centuries of Ottoman imperial rule.</p>
<p>Palestine owed its name to the Romans; to Muslims it was home to Jerusalem&rsquo;s al-Aqsa mosque (the third most sacred site after Mecca and Medina) from where the Prophet Muhammed ascended to heaven.</p>
<p><em>13</em> Locally it was regarded as part of Bilad al-Sham (Greater Syria) today roughly Syria, Lebanon and the Levant.</p>
<p>It had not been a separate unit since Sultan Selim I had defeated the Mamluk rulers of Syria and Egypt in 1517.</p>
<p>It was divided into <em>sanjaqs</em> or districts ruled from the provinces of Damascus or Beirut.</p>
<p>In 1872 Jerusalem, along with the <em>sanjaqs</em> of Nablus and Acre formed the region commonly referred to as Southern Syria or Palestine.</p>
<p>The principal Christian denominations regarded Palestine as a separate entity; in Arabic it was called <em>al-ard al-Muqaddasah</em> - the Holy Land. The Hebrew <em>Eretz haKodesh</em> had the same meaning.</p>
<p>Palestine was bordered by the east by the river Jordan and the Dead Sea, in the west by the Mediterranean, and after a British-Ottoman agreement in 1906, by a marked frontier with Egypt.</p>
<p>On the eve of the first World War the primary identity of its majority Arab-speaking population Muslim population was local as well as Palestinian but not in a manner than demanded independence from the sultan. A small elite which advocated autonomy within the Ottoman Empire held to the notion that there was a single Arab nation united by a common language and culture.</p>
<p>Christians were influenced by notions of nationalism and patriotism they derived from missionary schools.</p>
<p>Palestinian identity was also developing in opposition to the Zionist movement, which had been growing since the 1880s.</p>
<p>On 2 November 1917 Lord Balfour, Britain&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary wrote to Lord Rothschild of the World Zionist Organisation informing him that the Brits favoured the establishment of a national homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine.</p>
<p>In doing so Lloyd George wanted to outsmart the French in postwar operations in the Levant and grasp the opportunity to use Palestine&rsquo;s strategic location to protect Egpyt, the Suez Canal as well as the passage to India. An additional calculation may have been its propaganda value in Russia and the US, its consequences for Sykes-Picot agreement between Britain, France and Russia with regard to post-war spheres of influence in West Asia and pledges about Arab independence made by the Brits in 1915 to encourage Sharif Hussein to launch his revolt against the Turks.</p>
<p><em>16</em> Balfour stipulated that nothing be done to violate the rights of existing non-Jewish communities which formed 90% of Palestine&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>This clause was in place due to the objections of Lord Curzon, former viceroy of India, predicting Arab discontent at their being expropriated and disenfranchised by Zionist settlement.</p>
<p><em>17</em> Ottoman conscription had taken a heavy toll on the Arab population of 700,000; food, animals and fuel were in short supply due to the acquisitions of the Turkish military. Starvation rations and disease were the norm.</p>
<p>In 1915 poor harvests and a plague of locusts added to the impact of the Allied naval blockade of Palestinian and Syrian ports.</p>
<p>The Jewish population - 59,000 on the eve of the war - was depleted by emigration and deportation of enemy nationals, especially Russians. Some took Ottoman citizenship, leading Zionists were jailed, Arab nationalists were hanged.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Expeditionary Force began an assault on Gaza in March 1917. In April the civilian populations of Jaffa and Tel Aviv were ordered to leave. Beersheba and Gaza were captured in October and November.</p>
<p><em>18</em> C.P. Scott&rsquo;s view that the Palestinians were uncivilised is presented as representative of European opinion, as is the suggestion that they would benefit from the Zionist project.</p>
<p><strong>1882 - 1917</strong></p>
<p><em>19</em> In 1918 the British military administration counted 512,000 Muslims, 66,000 Jews and 61,000 Christians.</p>
<p>The Arabs were largely peasants, artisans and in the countryside where Bedouin tribes roamed, overwhelmingly illiterate. Large tracts of land were in the hands of absentee owners. Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa were the urban centres.</p>
<p>By 1918 some 15,000 Jewish newcomers were living in 45 rural colonies that made up the new Zionist camp, which was distinct from the 50,000 strong old Jewish community.</p>
<p><em>20</em> Jews had always been in Palestine. Over the previous century Ashkenazi Jews, mostly Russian or Eastern European, had come to study and pray, subsisting on charitable contributions in Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias and Safed, where they mourned the destruction of the Temple.</p>
<p>The majority came after 1840 after the Ottomans defeated a rebellion by the Egyptian Pasha Muhammed Ali. A minority were native-born Sephardi or Mizrahi Jews, whose ancestors were from Spain, North Africa, the Balkans. Many spoke Arabic or Ladino; their identity was religious, but not national, most were Ottoman citizens.</p>
<p>Relations between Christians, Muslims and Jews were not contentious, they lived under the Ottoman system of communal religious autonomy under the sultan in Istanbul. Inequalities existed in status and taxation but there was tolerance in mixed neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem Ashkenazi formed a majority, speaking a Palestinian variant of Yiddish, the vernacular of the Russian &lsquo;Pale of Settlement&rsquo; but replete with Arabic words.</p>
<p>Sephardim were culturally closer to Muslims than Christians.</p>
<p>Palestine&rsquo;s connections with the wider world had deepened in the mid nineteenth century thanks to Ottoman reforms, European investment and the expansion of trade and communication. European consulates had been established in the years after the Crimean War in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa to deal with Christian pilgrims and increasing missionary activity. Economic growth driven by exports of wheat and citrus fruit boosted the population in coastal cities.</p>
<p><em>21</em> Zionism proper begins with the outbreak of large-scale pogroms in the Russian Empire. The first settlers called themselves <em>Hovevi Tzion</em> (Lovers of Zion), a network of groups who sought to forge a Jewish national life in Palestine and use the Hebrew language rather than Yiddish.</p>
<p><em>22</em> In theory the Ottoman authorities were hostile to settlers but in practice the administration was vulnerable to bribes.</p>
<p>Settlers depended on Arab labour for transport, supplies and fertiliser.</p>
<p><em>24</em> Disputes arose over the demarcation of land boundaries and grazing rights with farmers dispossessed by sale who had been working land for absentee landlords. In 1886 riots broke out in Petah Tikvah after a Jewish farmer confiscated Arab-owned donkeys grazing on his land.</p>
<p>By 1889 Zichron had 1,200 Arab agricultural workers serving 200 Jews. In Rishon LeZion 40 Jewish families attracted 300 Arab families to work as migrant labourers; they were cheaper, more expendable and more hard-working than Jewish immigrants from Europe.</p>
<p>Arab objections begann to take on a more overtly political character.</p>
<p><em>25</em> In 1891 the Arabs urged an end to Jewish immigration and land purchases, but Arab notables continued to sell their land; prices were high.</p>
<p><em>26</em> Theodore Herzl, the Viennesse journalist who founded Zionism knew v little about life in Ottoman Palestine. His quest for a Jewish homeland began in the wake of the Dreyfus affair in France.</p>
<p>In 1896 he published <em>Der Judenstaat</em> (the Jewish State), which referred to Palestine and Argentina as two countries which would be suitable on the basis of their history as &rsquo;experiments in colonisation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The first Zionist Congress, held in Basel in 1897, founded the Zionist Organisation whose goal was a publicly recognised legally secured home in Palestine for Jewish people. At this stage there was eighteen new colonies in the country and the Ottomans appointed an official committee to examine land purchase activity; sales were halted for the next few years. Herzl visited Palestine two months later, his diary makes no reference to the Arab residents.</p>
<p>Arab hostility was becoming more evident around the turn of the century; the eviction of peasants from land purchased in Galilee by the Jewish Colonisation Association (JCA) led to attacks on Jewish surveyors.</p>
<p>By 1904 5,500 settlers were living in 25 agricultural colonies in 3 blocs; in eastern Upper Galilee, south of Haifa and south-east of Jaffa. This year the authorities banned the sale of land to foreign Jews.</p>
<p><em>29</em> The immigration and colonisation effort was better co-ordinated from 1908 onwards, the year the Young Turk revolution overthrew the Sultan. The Zionist Organisation set up its first premises in Palestine, to supplement the Zionist office in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Instances in which Jewish settlers were attacked and their farms pillages increased significantly.</p>
<p><em>30</em> Local opposition also came from Sephardic Jews who called on Zionists to embrace Arab rather than import European culture, but they had little influence.</p>
<p><em>33</em> Even as Arabs were being kicked off their lands Zionists emphasised the benefits which would accrue to them through settlement; through the creation of jobs, productive use being made of the land, etc.</p>
<p>Calls to replace Arab labourers by Jews, even at a higher cost to employers, increased after the second <em>aliya</em> (&lsquo;ascent&rsquo; or &lsquo;wave of immigration&rsquo;) in 1904; which included Russian socialists, among them David Gruen, born in Poland, who Hebraized his name to Ben-Gurion.</p>
<p>A group of Russian Jews from the Marxist <em>Poalei Zion</em> movement formed <em>HaShomer</em> (The Watchmen on Guard), to replace Arab settlement guards, which became the vanguard of a radical Zionist frontier ethos.</p>
<p><em>34</em> This new mentality, which was behind attacks on Arab workers and Jewish farmers who employed them, was praised by Zionist writers.</p>
<p>Between 1882 and 1909 thirteen Jews were killed by Arabs, but only two were politically motivated; from this point on politicaly motivated killings increase, generally in the wake of evictions.</p>
<p>This consolidated racist and anti-Arab attitudes among Zionists, though there were some who spoke publically about a co-operative model of settlement.</p>
<p><strong>1917 - 1929</strong></p>
<p><em>39</em> Sephardi had been encouraged to severe contacts with Arabs after intimidation from Ashkenazim.</p>
<p>In June 1918 Chaim Weizmann travelled to Aqaba in Transjordan to meet Emir Faisal, the third son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca and commander of the Arab forces that had fought the Turks with British support. Weizmann had a dismissive attitude to the Palestinians, but admired Faisal; his objective in meeting him was to &rsquo;localise the Arab question&rsquo;, use Jewish influence in the US to assist Arab nationalists in return for their support or non-involvement in Zionist affairs.</p>
<p>In January 1919 they signed an agreement, the fourth article of which laid out how all measures shall be taken to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale. It stipulated that Arab farmer rights would be respected and all Islamic holy sites would remain under Arab control.</p>
<p>However, with French and British control across the region, this agreement was a dead letter.</p>
<p>Ben-Gurion, leader of the Labour Unity movement was the foremost pessimist with regard to a strategy of co-operation with Arabs: saw clearly that it was a zero-sum game.</p>
<p><em>40</em> In March 1920 the settlements of Metullah and Tel Hai were attacked; a cult of martyrdom began to develop among the settlers.</p>
<p><em>42-3</em> Zionists complained the Brits were not acting against the Palestinians, but Jewish representatives were assured there would be sufficient security during the Nebi Musa pilgrimage near Jericho in April. In the event, three days of violence left 5 Jews dead and 200 injured, 4 Arabs killed and 25 injured. The right-wing militant Zionist Vladimir Jabotinsky, who had served in the British Army during the war and had led Jewish efforts, was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude; this service was reduced to a year.</p>
<p>A distinct Palestinian national identity began to take shape; in February 1919 the first congress of Muslim-Christian Associations (MCA) declared unity with Syria though this support faded when Faisal&rsquo;s rule collapsed, he was expelled by the French the following summer and there was suspicion after his deal with Weizmann.</p>
<p>In May 1920 the San Remo conference granted Britain the Mandate for Palestine under the League of Nations; Syria, including Lebanon and Mesopotamia (Iraq) were to be recognised as provisionally independent but in reality were under the yoke of Britain and France &lsquo;until such a time as they are able to stand alone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Transjordan was briefly a no-man&rsquo;s-land until being attached to the British Palestine Mandate but was exempted from Balfour&rsquo;s pledge under the rule of Faisal&rsquo;s brother, Emir Abdullah bin Hussein; the Arab Peninsula remained a battleground between Sharif Hussein and the Al Saud.</p>
<p><em>44</em> Britain&rsquo;s first high commissioner for Palestine was Sir Herbert Samuel, a leading liberal Jewish politician.</p>
<p>The Mandate incorporated the Balfour Declaration almost verbatim; English, Arabic and Hebrew were declared official languages. A &lsquo;Jewish Agency&rsquo; was created to advise the administration but no such agency was in place for Arabs; the document did not even use the word &lsquo;Arab&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In December 1920 the MCA&rsquo;s third Palestinian Congress in Haifa dropped its demand for union with Syria and rejected the Balfour declaration. It elected an Arab Executive (AE) committee led by Musa Kazem al-Husseini of the eminent Jerusalem family. Palestinians began to focus more on Palestine, publishing works of geography and history.</p>
<p><em>45</em> Chaim Kalvarisky, a Polish-born and French educated land agent in Galilee, was tasked by the Zionist executive to promote a Muslim National Association to compete with the MCA.</p>
<p>Other plans to buy off Arab opposition failed due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p><em>46</em> Lawyer Awni Abdel-Hadi of Nablus wrote that he preferred dealing with Zionists who did not seek rapproachement as they are more open about their motives.</p>
<p>In May 1921 violence erupted in Jaffa.</p>
<p><em>47</em> Over six days of violence 41 Jews and 44 Arabs were killed.</p>
<p>Sir Herbert Samuel called for a halt to Jewish immigration which infuriated the Zionists; fines and other collective punishments were imposed on the Arabs.</p>
<p><em>48</em> A volunteer Zionist defense organisation was set up called the <em>Haganah</em> (Defence). Arms were smuggled in, intelligence-gathering on Arabs was initiated, Jabotinsky campaigned for for the revival of Jewish battalions who fought in WWI and their incorporation into the British garrison in Palestine.</p>
<p>A British report notes the almost complete breakdown in relations between formerly friendly Jews and Arabs.</p>
<p><em>49</em> The Zionist enterprise had begun four decades ago but had not not yet brought about a significant demographic transformation; Palestine&rsquo;s 757,000 inhabitants were overwhelmingly Arab, with a Jewish minority of 83,000 or 11% of the population. The third <em>aliya</em>, from 1919 - 23 brought in 35,000 Russian, Polish newcomers, who played an important role in establishing <em>kubbutzim</em> and other collection Zionist organisations; they built roads, drained swamps and undertook other public construction projects.</p>
<p><em>50</em> Employing Arabs was increasingly frowned upon.</p>
<p>The fourth <em>aliya</em> is dated from 1924 - 29, the majority were Polish, escaping waves of anti-Semetic persecution.</p>
<p>Weizmann looked down on this new generation of immigrants; in comparison to previous generations of ideologically motivated pioneers this cohort was less interested in embarking on a settler colonial project.</p>
<p><em>53</em> Land purchases expanded and more Jewish settlements were established along the coastal plain.</p>
<p>The annual conference of <em>Ahdut haAvoda</em>, held at one of the first <em>kibbutzim</em> at Ein Harod concluded that the future of the state depended on the joint organisation of Israeli and Arab workers, as there was no Arab national movement and political agreement with them was impossible. Ben-Gurion spoke out against representative government.</p>
<p><em>54</em> When a new organisation <em>Brit Shalom</em> was established in order to foster dialogue and co-operation between Arabs and Jews and promote a bi-national state it was met with hostility from the Zionist establishment.</p>
<p>The Arabs declared a general strike when Lord Balfour, along with Weizmann and Field Marshall Alleby attended its inauguration.</p>
<p><em>55</em> Nashashibi&rsquo;s Palestinian Arab National Party favoured co-operation with the British administration and were denounced as traitors by the Arab Executive. Zionists took advantage of divisions among the Arabs to the point of financially supporting one side against the other.</p>
<p>Land purchases began to edge out traditional farming methods in cereal cultivation and herding.</p>
<p><em>56</em> A dispute developed over the western wall of the Herodian temple compound in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City, which Jews believed was the site of the Temple of Soloman. It is also the Western wall of the Haram al-Sharif known to Muslims as <em>al-Buraq</em>, named after the horse the Prophet Muhammed had tethered there before ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>Under the Ottomans the Jews were not permitted to place benches, screens or do anything which might lay claim to possession though in practice these edicts were often ignored. Little changed under the Brits. In 1922 the Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) opposed any attempt to enhance Jewish access and Haj Amin, the Grand Mufti, raised a large amount of money to renovate the Haram.</p>
<p><em>57</em> This dispute escalated on Yom Kippur 1928 when Jews brought a screen to separate male and female worshipers, which was removed by police. The SMC started a campaign to tighten restrictions. On 16 August a Kurdish Jewish teenager was stabbed to death</p>
<p><em>58</em> The biggest Arab attack in response to this news took place in Hebron, home of the Tomb of the Patriarchs and the Ibrahimi mosque. Sixty-four victims from the city&rsquo;s Orthodox Jewish community.</p>
<p><em>59</em> In June 1930 three Arabs, convicted of murder in Hebron and similar disturbances in Safed were hanged in Acre prison; vigils were held in Haifa and Nablus; by contrast, the Jewish policeman who killed an entire Arab family in Jaffa had his death sentence commuted.</p>
<p><em>61</em> A British White Paper produced in 1930 implied that future Jewish immigration to Palestine might have to be restricted due to the growing crisis in Arab landholding, exacerbated by Jewish boycotts.</p>
<p><em>63</em> Ben-Gurion, now a powerful figure in the labour movement, spoke about the irreconcilable ambitions of Arabs and Zionists and emphasised the need to continue immigration and secure the gaps between existing settlement.</p>
<p>After the violence of 1929 there was a marked increase in physical separation in the cities; with Arabs moving to move Arab-dominated areas and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>1929 - 36</strong></p>
<p><em>66</em> By 1931 Jews, numbering 175,000, still constituted less than 17% of the country&rsquo;s population. In December the Grand Mufti Hai Amin al-Husseini convened an Islamic conference in Jerusalem to warn of a Jewish threat to Muslim holy places, Arab newspapers warned of the selling of land and shamed those who did.
In 1930 British policemen pulled down Bedouin tents to clear the land for Jewish settlers. This ended with the eviction of 1,200 Bedouin and began the practice of renaming the area in Hebrew.</p>
<p>Attempts to set up a fund to compete with the Zionists failed.</p>
<p><em>67</em> Frustration with shortcomings in Arab leadership lead to the formation of the pan-Arab Istiqlal (Independence Party), by Awni Abdel-Hadi in 1932, part of a trend which saw Palestinian political life move away from the great aristocratic and merchant families to a younger generation of nationalist activists, often journalists and teachers, who had benefited from a European education and were influenced by Gandhi&rsquo;s struggle against the British in India.</p>
<p>Party activity was centred in Haifa and its party programme was directed towards econonomic independence and the toppling of the British Mandate on the basis that Zionism would collapse with it.</p>
<p>Akram Zuwayter, a leading figure in the party, resigned his post as a teacher in a government school in Acre. Mayors and other Arab officials came under pressure to resign too. A National Congress of Arab Youth patrolled the Mediterranean coastline to prevent illegal Jewish immigrants from landing, underlining that the Mandate was not enforcing its own laws; Jews made up nearly a third of the population in 1936.</p>
<p><em>68</em> Under pressure from the radicals the Arab Executive called a general strike against British policy. In Jaffa in October 1933 police opened fire on demonstrators and killed 26 Arabs, injured ~200. Protests followed in Nablus, Haifa and Gaza.</p>
<p><em>71</em> Secret military organisations such as the <em>Jihad al-Muqaddas</em> (Holy War) led by Abdul-Qader al-Husseini, the son of Musa Kazem and the Mufti&rsquo;s nephew were formed. By 1934 it had collected financial contributions and some firearms.</p>
<p>Other smaller groups followed a similar path, obtaining arms by clandestine means and entering into military training.</p>
<p>The best-known group, known as the Black Hand, was led by Shiekh Izzedin al-Qassam, a Syrian-born preacher, who urged Bedouin to resist settlement by armed methods.</p>
<p><strong>1936 - 9</strong></p>
<p><em>74</em> On 15 April 1936 three armed Arabs forced vehicles passing the road near Nur Shams to stop and give them money to buy weapons and ammunition. They shot three Jews they held up, two of whom died.</p>
<p>The following day two members of a Zionist organisation killed two Arab labourers in a shack near Petah Tiikvah.</p>
<p><em>75</em> Riots spread to Jaffa in the 19th, with nine Jews killed and sixty injured. Curfews were imposed by the police and troops, strikes spread across Arab areas, led by local national committees, clubs and unions.</p>
<p>The Husseini and Nashashibi families, under pressure, dropped their rivalry and formed a new Arab Higher Committee (AHC) under the Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini which called for a general strike, civil disobedience and non-payment of taxes.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the great rebellion, during which crops were burned and there was shooting at Zionist vehicles. Bombs went off in Haifa and Jaffa and the railway line to Egypt was sabotaged near Gaza.</p>
<p><em>76</em> In August 1936 Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Lebanese veteran of the struggle against the French arrived at the head of a five-hundred strong band of Syrians, Iraqis and Palestinians to try and consolidate the rebel force into an army.</p>
<p><em>77</em> Zionists represented the rebels as bandits, used the strike to get rid of Arab workers in the ports and quarries.</p>
<p><em>78</em> Two hundred buildings were destroyed in Jaffa to clear the way for the British military; leaving 6,000 Arabs homeless.</p>
<p>The strike ended in October 1936 when British efforts orchestrated an appeal by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Transjordan and Yemen.</p>
<p><em>80</em> The Peel Report, produced by former secretary for India, presented partition as the only solution, with the Jewish state covering 25% of Palestine, north from Tel Aviv along the coast including the overwhelmingly Arab Galilee.</p>
<p>The Arab state would encompass the mountains and the Negev desert, as well as Jaffa, and be linked to Transjordan. Britain would continue to control Jerusalem, Bethlehem and a corridor to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>This provoked debate in the Zionist movement as it did not include Jerusalem, Hebron or Judea; Jabotinsky insisted the plan was absurd while Weizmann and Ben-Gurion called for more territory.</p>
<p>The Arab Higher Committee dismissed any idea of partitioning the land, prayers were made in public against partition.</p>
<p><em>81</em> The AHC repeated its demands for an end to Jewish immigration and purchases, and for the replacement of a Mandate with a treaty between British and a sovereign and independent Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Negotiations taking place between Arab and Zionist agencies stalled when the Zionists rejected the idea of Bedouins and illiterate Arabs having the same democratic rights as &lsquo;sophisticated&rsquo; European Jews.</p>
<p>Attacks on British military targets began again in September 1937, blamed on al-Qassam supporters.</p>
<p><em>82</em> The Arab Higher Committee and national committee were proscribed and dozens were arrested. Haj Amin al-Husseini was removed from the presidency of the Supreme Muslim Council and went into exile in Lebanon. Other Arab leaders, including the Mayor of Jerusalem Hussein Khalidi were deported to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>In October Arabs attacks buses, railways, the Iraqi pipeline and army posts. Armed groups formed into larger regional units which competed for support from Damascus, where the AHC had established the Central Committee for Jihad under Izzat Darwaza, which collected money and sent supplies and weapons to the Palestinian rebels. The French authorities declined British pressure to interfere.</p>
<p><em>83</em> British policeman from the time:</p>
<p>&lsquo;running over an Arab is the same as a dog in England except we do not report it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Tegart, a colonial policeman, also a veteran of India recommended the construction of concrete forts across the country, the introduction of Doberman dogs from South Africa for use in searches and the opening of an Arab interrogation centre in Jerusalem where waterboarding and other forms of torture were common.</p>
<p>The revolt peaked in August with 9 - 10,000 rebels, 3,000 of whom were full-time fighters. British forces consisted of two army divisions; 25,000 servicemen. The British administered collective punishment on Arab villages, demanding fines, razing houses, confiscating livestock, uprooting trees. Arabs were made to act as human shields by sitting on inspection trolleys which drove on the railways ahead of trains or forced to ride on lorries with army convoys. Once the journey was over the lorry would brake hard to throw the victim off and then run over him, either maiming or killing him. A squaddie:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there was any land mines it was them [the Arab prisoners] that hit them. Rather a dirty trick, but we enjoyed it&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>84</em> Until the winter of 1937 there were few instances of Jews attacking Arabs due to a lack of military capacity or experience.</p>
<p><em>85</em> Anti-Arab attacks began to be carried out by the National Military Organisation, the militant group inspired by Jabotinsky.</p>
<p>In April 1938 Shlomo Ben-Yosef, a member of the Revisionist youth movement, fired at an Arab bus in Galilee. When Ben-Yosef was hanged by the Brits, the Irgun kidnapped and hanged an Arab in Haifa and, using Mizrahi Jews disguised as Arabs, placed bombs in markets and public places, killing at least thirty-five Arabs in an attack in July.</p>
<p><em>86</em> In 1938 a commission of inquiry headed by Sir John Woodhead arrived in Jerusalem to investigate the unrest and review prospects for partition, deciding Peel&rsquo;s proposals were not workable; three alternative partition schemes were arrived at with different boundaries and administrative arrangements; none of them were acceptable to either Zionists or Arabs and recommended the future of the country be reviewed at a London conference.</p>
<p>The AHC opposed co-operation with the commission, those who agreed to come forward were executed or sentenced to death by revolutionary courts in absentia.</p>
<p><em>87</em> A counter-insurgency campaign was ramped up with the help of Fakhri Abdel-Hadi, a former rebel commander from Arrabeh on the Brits&rsquo; payroll.</p>
<p>The rebellion was ultimately put down by air superiority as well as anti-rebel peasant formations in Nablus and among the Druze of Mount Carmel around Haifa. Peace bands were rounded up at rallies with the view to spreading the message that the vast majority of Arabs did not support an uprising.</p>
<p><em>88</em> New settlements were more militaristic as Zionists became more militarily experienced; 3,000 Jews were recruited into the supernumerary police by October 1936. By summer 1939 22,000 Jews were serving in it.</p>
<p><em>89</em> Haganah men joined a new British unit called the Special Night Squads (SNS), established after the Iraqi pipeline had been sabotaged. They led a brutal campaign of counter-insurgency, involving whipping, torture and executions.</p>
<p><em>90</em> The Brits&rsquo; White Paper in May abandoned partition but restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine to 75,000 over the next five years with subsequent figures depending on Arab consent, placed restrictions on the right of Jews to buy land.</p>
<p>It also provided for the creation of an independent Palestinian state in ten years and the immediate appointment of Palestinians to the head of certain industries, made clear that it did not wish to construct a Jewish state against the wishes of the majority of the people in the area.</p>
<p>The Zionists obviously rejected it, the majority of the members of the AHC approved but the exiled mufti rejected.</p>
<p><strong>6: 1939 - 45</strong></p>
<p><em>94</em> 5,000 Palestinians had been killed in the counter-insurgency campaign, 146 hanged and thousands detained. Thousands of homes were demolished, leaders of the Arab Higher Committee were in exile or in jail.</p>
<p>Ben-Gurion pledged to fight the White Paper, with its restrictions on immigration, land purchases and minority status for Jews.</p>
<p><em>98</em> The Biltmore Programme, developed in a hotel of the same name in Manhattan called for unrestricted Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Israel, its programme did not mention the Arab population.</p>
<p>The Zionists worked to influence USian opinion against the Brits.</p>
<p><em>100 - 1</em> Zionist intelligence organisations began to organise around the Jewish Agency and the Haganah.</p>
<p>Spying, collecting information on Arab villages, political allegiances and activity.</p>
<p>Hikes were organised among young Jews for this purpose; presented as an innocent youthful activity but in reality an intelligence gathering operation.</p>
<p><em>103</em> This data was exploited for land purchases, sometimes paid Palestinian informants were used as middlemen to encourage the Palestinians to part with their cash.</p>
<p>Information was collected on Arab landholders who were in debt.</p>
<p><strong>1945 - 49</strong></p>
<p><em>105 - 6</em> Series of attacks by Palestinian rebels and Zionist militias escalate.</p>
<p>In October 1945 the Haganah and Irgun launched a co-ordinated rebellion against Tan rule by sabotaging the railway system. In April 1946 the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry recommended the country be governed under bi-national principles and that 100,000 Jewish refugees enter the country.</p>
<p>In June another <em>Haganah</em> operation destroyed all bridges connecting Palestine to neighbouring countries. 2,700 Jews were rounded up by the Brits including most Jewish agency leaders and a large part of the Haganah command.</p>
<p>Three weeks later the Irgun blew up the King David Hotel, the headquarters of the British administration, killing 91 people about third of whom were Jewish.</p>
<p><em>107</em> The Brits kicked the question of the state to a UN-appointed Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), the Palestinians refused to participate.</p>
<p>In September seven of the UNs ten members recommended partition with international status for Jerusalem. The minority (India, Iran and Yugoslavia) proposed a federal state with Jerusalem as capital.</p>
<p>Intense Zionist lobbying secured a majority of 33 to 13 with ten abstentions.</p>
<p>UN Resolution 181 was backed by the US and the USSR, it was opposed by Palestinians and Arab states.</p>
<p>The proposed Jewish state was to consist of 55% of the country, including the unpopulated Negev desert. Its population would comprise 500,000 Jews and 400,000 Arabs.</p>
<p>At this point Jews owned 7% of Palestine&rsquo;s private land, the Arab state was to have 44% of the land and a minority of 10,000 Jews. Greater Jerusalem would remain under international rule.</p>
<p>Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini declared this UN vote null and void.</p>
<p><em>108</em> The Palestinian leadership called for a general strike while the Haganah called on Jews aged between 17 to 25 to register for military service.</p>
<p>The Zionists accepted the decision, the Arabs rejected any abrogation of its sovereignty.</p>
<p><em>110</em> The Arab Higher Committee, outlawed in 1937, had been revived under the mufti in exile. In May 1946 Haj Amin al-Husseini arrived in Egypt under the protection of King Farouk amid hope of a new resistance.</p>
<p>However the Arab National Fund had not succeeded in halting land sales, calls to boycott Jewish produce had not been heeded and many supporters of Palestinian nationhood condemned the incompetent leadership.</p>
<p><em>111</em> The AHC was also divided between Jerusalem, Beirut and Damascus, undermining effective communication. Its influence was dwarfed by that of the League of Arab States, whose members, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, had their own agendas, the majority of whom were opposed to King Abdullah of Transjordan who had ambitions in Palestine.</p>
<p>The AHC had to build up Palestine&rsquo;s military capacity from scratch; nothing on their side matched the Haganah and the Arab effort was beset by rivalry; it was not until January 1947 that two existing paramilitaries the Futuwwa and the Najada were combined into a single Arab Youth Organisation.</p>
<p><em>112</em> Non-Palestinian forces were deployed by the Arab liberation Army, set up by the Arab League&rsquo;s Damascus-based military committee, it was made up of 5000 volunteers and seconded Syrian, Iraqi military personnel commanded by Fawzi al-Qawiqji. Morale was low, logistics and discipline were poor.</p>
<p>Arab States were patronising towards the Palestinians, some just went on a rampage and left, some Palestinians did not want to fight, had secret non-aggression pacts with their Jewish neighbours, opposed the Husseinis or refused to harbor foreign forces.</p>
<p><em>114</em> Palestinian civilians began to flee, in early 1947 <em>Haganah</em> reported that wealthy Arabs were moving to winter residences in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. By January 15,000 of Jaffa&rsquo;s residents had left. The AHC tried to stem these departures by radio broadcasts, urging neighbouring nations not to take Arabs but this was ineffective.</p>
<p><em>115</em> On 10 March 1948 Haganah commanders met in Tel Aviv to discuss plans to secure control of Jewish-held territory within and beyond UN partition borders. Arabs were to be expelled if they resisted, effectively ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p><em>116</em> The Haganah went on the offensive as the British departure neared and supplies of food ran low in Jewish areas of Jerusalem, capturing territory that was not earmarked under the Jewish plan.</p>
<p>Husseini, the head of the AHJ, was killed at the Arab hill-top village of Qastel.</p>
<p><em>117 - 8</em> On 9 April an Irgun-Lehi force launched an offensive on Deir Yassin, on the western edge of Jerusalem, there were reports of executions, rapes and looting, with whole families, women and children being killed, between 1 - 200 people were killed.</p>
<p>The Arab Press reported on the massacre prompted flight from nearby villages.</p>
<p>Revenge came when Arab fighters ambushed a convoy of trucks, ambulances, buses and armoured cars heading to a Jewish enclave on Jerusalem&rsquo;s Mount Scopus, 78 lecturers, students, nurses odctors and Haganah escorts were killed.</p>
<p><em>119</em> The war was won by the Zionists as Haganah units continued offensive operations helped by the arrival of rifles, machine guns and ammunition purchased from Czechslovakia.</p>
<p>Haifa and Tiberias, two cities with large Arab populations were taken.</p>
<p><em>121</em> When Haganah units entered Jaffa on 14 May only 3 - 40,00 residents remained, Zionist forces raided and looted what had been left.</p>
<p><em>122</em> The Haganah made further incursions into areas they expected neighbouring Arab states to invade, by mid-May 250,000 - 300,000 Palestinians had fled or been expelled from their homes.</p>
<p>On 15 May High Commissioner Cunningham left Haifa harbour. The previous evening the sovereign state of Israel was proclaimed as David Ben-Gurion read the declaration of independence on behalf of the Provisional Government; the state was recognised within hours by the US and the USSR.</p>
<p>Jordanian, Egyptian, Iraqi and Syrian armies invaded, with Lebanon opting out at the last minute.</p>
<p><em>123</em> Initial plans focused on invading northern Palestine with a view to reaching Haifa. King Abdullah announced Jordanian forces would head for Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron along what came to be known as the West Bank. This suggested he was seeking to avoid war with Israel by refraining from entering areas allotted to them by the UN and seemed to confirm suspicious re: collusion between the Brits, Zionist and the Hashemites which prompted the Egyptians to add a second invasion route, rather than moving forces up the coast towards Gaza and Tel Aviv, to take their forces East, an obvious attempt to outflank Abdullah.</p>
<p>Israelis encounters only Iraqi and Syrian forces in the Jordan Valley but no Egyptians, Iraqi units in Qalqilya did nothing, telling Palestinians they had no orders. Some Saudi and Yemeni troops were aso deployed.</p>
<p>Palestinian fighters were helped in Jerusalem by the arrival of Jordanian Arab Legion forces, greeted by crowds, Haganah fighters were taken prisoner after surrendering.</p>
<p><em>124</em> Israeli forces took more territory; the Alexandroni Brigade cleared more than sixty Arab villages on the plain between Tel Aviv and Haifa. The Israelis also made conquests in Galilee and in the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem &lsquo;corridor&rsquo; that the UN had allocated to the Arabs.</p>
<p><em>125</em> Nazareth was taken 16 July.</p>
<p>Operation Dani was intended to capture Arab towns of Lydda and Ramle, alloted to the Arab state, in the centre of the country and clear the last Arab-held parts of adjacent Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road. In Lydda on 12 July Israeli forces encountered a small Arab Legion force entering the town. During the ensuing firefight 250 Palestinians sheltering in a mosque compound were killed by men of the IDF&rsquo;s Yiftah Brigade; biggest atrocity of the war.</p>
<p>50,000 Palestinians were expelled on Ben-Gurion&rsquo;s orders to the Israeli commander Yitzak Rabin. Lydda residents were forced to walk for miles in summer heat in the middle of the Ramadan fast to the front lines where Arab Legion struggled to provide shelter and supplies. Unknown numbers died of exhaustion or dehydration.</p>
<p><em>126</em> A further 100,000 became refugees in the course of those ten days.</p>
<p>Under UN pressure a new open-ended truce came into effect on 18 July. Israel continued to launch operations but claimed they were not violations of this truce; Arab expulsions were ongoing. The Stern Gang assassinated the UN mediator.</p>
<p><em>128</em> Mass killing at Dawamiya.</p>
<p>Operation Hiram - New Israeli conquests in eastern Galilee, allotted to the Arab state by the UN, several villages across the border in Lebanon also occupied.</p>
<p>Atrocities in Eilabun, Safsaf and Jish led to the flight of 30,000 more Palestinians, mostly to Lebanon. Ben-Gurion instructed his units:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do all in your power for a quick and immediate cleansing of the conquered areas of all the hostile elements&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>129</em> Overall Palestinian casualities are estimated at around 13,000, 1,400 Egyptians, several hundred Iraqis and Jordanians, 4,000 Israelis.</p>
<p><strong>1949 - 53</strong></p>
<p><em>131</em> In the course of twenty months half the pre-war Arab population had fled or been driven out; 350 - 400 villages had been depopulated, many were destroyed or settled by Jewish immigrants.</p>
<p>In some areas families were divided by armistice lines which left a minority of 156,000 Palestinians in the new Jewish state, 15% of its population.</p>
<p><em>132</em> Refugees were scattered across the West Bank, occupied by Jordan, in the Egyptian-administered Gaza Strip, its original population more than doubled, in makeshift camps in Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Iraq. Majority were uneducated farmers, initially under the care of the Red Cross and then the United Nations Relief and Works Agency; many camps were shanty towns and lacked basic amenities such as running water, electricity, sewage systems.</p>
<p><em>133 - 4</em> Israel made clear early on that refugees would not be allowed to return, putting forward the narrative that they had left voluntarily, which was reproduced abroad.</p>
<p><em>135</em> Palestinian women who had fled were left so destitute they were forced into prostitution; more than 400 babies in camps around Tyre and Sidon died of cold.</p>
<p><em>136</em> Israel lifted British restrictions on immigration, in July 1950 the Law of Return granted Jews from all over the world the right to live in Israel over the native non-Jewish population. The Jewish population increased to 1.5 million in 1951, most of the newcomers arriving from Arab countries such as Iraq and Yemen where anti-Jewish sentiment had grown.</p>
<p><em>137</em> The intellectual core of Palestinian life was destroyed, as was the commercial and manufacturing bases of the Arab economy. The vast majority of those left were illiterate villagers and agricultural workers.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s national library collected 30,000 books, newspapers and other items from the abandoned homes of Palestinians who had fled West Jerusalem. Five of the eleven cities under Israeli control, Safed, Madjal, Tiberias, Beisan and Beersheba were emptied of Arabs; Jaffa, Haifa, Lydda, Ramle and Acre almost were.</p>
<p><em>138</em> The majority of Israel&rsquo;s Arabs lived in Galilee, along the Jordanian border north east of Tel Aviv and in the Negev, under military rule.</p>
<p>When the military government was established it employed two key provisions of the 1945 British Defence Emergency Regulations: the authority to declare any area closed to the public and impose a curfew.</p>
<p>Abandoned Arab land was allocated to Jews; Arab movements in and out of closed areas were regulated under a system of checkpoints, travel permits, curfews and other restrictions.</p>
<p>These permits were in Hebrew and hence illegible to those who used them and had to be approved by Shin Bet, who used them as leverage to secure informants.</p>
<p>The ministries of education, welfare, interior and religious affairs had special sections to govern the Palestinians as a separate section of the population.</p>
<p><em>146</em> Security experts opposed enfranchising Arabs, warning they would seek restitution of property and freedom of movement, but these were over-ruled.</p>
<p>In the first parliamentary elections in January 1949 3 Arab MPs entered the 120 seat Knesset. Arab lists, created by the ruling Labour party Mapai, creted a link between Arab notables who remained in the country and the structures of the state, preventing the formation of a separate political Arab bloc of opposition.</p>
<p>Divide and rule strategy adopted; 20,000 strong Druze community, Circassians (descendants of Muslim immigrants expelled from the Caucasus in the nineteenth century) and Bedouin in the south all given special treatment.</p>
<p><em>147</em> In January 1949 the IDF created a minorities unit compromising 400 Druze, 200 Bedouins and 100 Circassians commanded by Jewish officers and employed it to ambush Palestinians trying to cross armistice lines; Druze were later subject to mandatory conscription, their role was described by one Israeli officer as &lsquo;a sharp knife in the back of Arab unity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sheikhs, religious judges and other notables were granted special dispensations that strengthened traditional social structures and consolidated control of Arab areas. Collaboration brought benefits such as work and travel permits, firearm licences, a blind eye to criminality corruption and even political office.</p>
<p><strong>1953 - 58</strong></p>
<p><em>150</em> On 12 October 1953 an IDF force crossed the green line into the West Bank village of Qibya. Unit 101 was under the command of Ariel Scheinerman (later Sharon) and killed 69 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children.</p>
<p><em>151</em> This was one of 200 raids which took place in the early years of Israel&rsquo;s independence.</p>
<p>Between 1949 and 1953 fifty-seven Israelis were killed by Palestinians from the West Bank, between 1949 and 1956 between 3 - 5000 Palestinians were killed by Israel.</p>
<p><em>153</em> In November 1955, shortly after Ben-Gurion entered back into power the IDF launched a punitive raid on Gaza in response to <em>fedayeen</em> incursions.</p>
<p>The war against Egypt was launched pre-emptively by Israel in collusion with Britain and France, infuriated by Nasser&rsquo;s takeover of the Suez canal, Israel claiming they were seeking to put an end fo <em>fedayeen</em> raids from Gaza.</p>
<p><em>154</em> Israeli forces occupied the desert peninsula for four months until US pressure forced Ben-Gurion to withdraw and drop any idea of annexing Gaza, two thirds of its population now refugees living in eight large camps.</p>
<p><em>155</em> Between 930 and 1200 Palestinians died before Israel did withdraw.</p>
<p>On 29 October 1956 Israeli authorities imposed a 5pm curfew on villages near the border w/ Jordan. In Kafr Qassem border guards shot and killed 49 unarmed Arab citizens, including women and children.</p>
<p><em>156</em> Nasser very popular among Arab minority, influential in the growing Arab nationalist movement.</p>
<p><em>159</em> In Israel the Nakba was not taught in schools or mentioned in print due to military censorship. The use of the word &lsquo;watan&rsquo; for &lsquo;homeland&rsquo; was also banned. A teacher was sacked for writing poetry about a mulberry tree in his old village of al-Mujaydil, renamed Migdal HaEmek in Hebrew.</p>
<p><em>160</em> The government produced a daily newspaper in Arabic reporting mainly on visits from government officials, the building of roads and other &lsquo;positive&rsquo; stories; it focused on the village and clan structures of Arab life, emphasising backwardness and orientalist stereotypes of underdevelopment, even when most Arabs lived in towns; it was widely mocked.</p>
<p><em>161</em> Fears were expressed for national security over the fact that knowledge of Arabic among Jews was declining; Arab writers usually learned Hebrew but things didn&rsquo;t flow the other way; parents preferred their kids to learn English and French rather than a &lsquo;backwards&rsquo; language like Arabic.</p>
<p>School tours were arranged by IDF intelligence to Druze villages and Nazareth with guides provided by intelligence officials but not the natives. Students of these Orientalist courses were expected to practice colloquial Arabic and learn about Arab customs but never speak to the native population about politics. These courses were followed by jobs in IDF intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>1958 - 67</strong></p>
<p><em>162</em> Israelis celebrated the tenth anniversary of their independence in April 1958 with a military parade in West Jerusalem.</p>
<p><em>164</em> The majority of citizens supported the state&rsquo;s policies in not taking back Arab refugees; that they had been responsible for the 1948 war and left voluntarily. A state inquiry heard testimony to this effect and emphasised the threat the Arabs represented to the state.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;Palestinian&rsquo; was not used in Hebrew or English discourse in the 1950s except on the far left.</p>
<p><em>165</em> Of nearly a million refugees more than half were under 15.</p>
<p><em>166</em> Dissatisfaction broke out at continuing restrictions on movement which still applied to 85% of Israeli Arabs. Communist organisers were arrested and a May Day rally banned. When this was ignored, with slogans such as &lsquo;End military rule&rsquo; and &lsquo;Long live Nasser&rsquo;, 300 were arrested.</p>
<p><em>167</em> A small group of Arab intellectuals founded The Land in the spirit of Nasserism and the Arab nationalist movement, calling for a repeal of all discriminatory laws and the right to return; this represented a parting of the ways between Arab nationalists and communist organisations.</p>
<p>Its call to boycott the 1959 Knesset elections led to weakened Arab representation and worried the security establishment.</p>
<p><em>168</em> In February 1958 Egypt and Syria announced the creation of the United Arab Republic. In May civil war broke out in in Lebanon, the July the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown, the US and Britain feared a Nasserist coup in Jordan; the Algerian rebellion was ongoing, a source of inspiration for Palestinians.</p>
<p>Jordan treated Palestinians better than any other Arab country, granting them citizenship rather than refugee status, but de-legitimated Palestinian nationality as it was thought this represented a challenge to Arab unity; use of the term Palestine in official documentation or correspondence was banned. Associations with a Palestinian character such as the Haifa cultural association in Balus, the Jaffa Muslim Sports Club in Ramallah were not allowed to engage in political activity.</p>
<p><em>169</em> Lebanon introduced the most severe restrictions on the 100 - 130,000 Palestinians who had arrived in 1949. Prejudice and mistreatment was common.</p>
<p>The majority of the 300,000 Palestinians in Egypt lived under military administration and emergency laws in the Gaza strip that lasted until 1962.</p>
<p><em>170</em> George Habash, a refugee from Lydda founded the ANM while he was a medical student in an American university in Beirut; the organisation was directed towards the union of all Arab states.</p>
<p>Yasser Arafat, born in Egypt in 1929 to a Gazan father and mother had lived in Jerusalem briefly, studied in Cairo university and fought in the 1948 war as part of a Muslim Brotherhood unit, complaining that he was disarmed twice, first by the Egyptian army and next while serving with Abdul-Qader al-Husseini by the Jordanian Arab legion.</p>
<p>Arafat failed to get a visa to Saudi Arabia and ended up in Kuwait as an engineer with the ministry of public works.</p>
<p><em>171</em> He founded the Palestinian Liberation Movement (or Fatah) with Salah Khalaf, a literature student born in Ramala and expelled to Gaza as a teenager.</p>
<p>Fatah received funding from wealthy families in the gulf including Kuwaiti and Qatari ruling families.</p>
<p><em>173</em> It sought to liberated the whole of Palestine and end the Zionist occupation, with an emphasis on armed struggle, influenced by Fanon, the black civil rights movement in the US and the Mau Mau, but they found it difficult to compete against Nasserism, by 1963 the organisation still had only a few hundred members.</p>
<p>The break-up of the Egypt-Syria union in September 1961 and the civil war in Yemen with Saudis and Nasser backing opposing sides were blows to Arab unity and the success of the FLN in 1962 gave credibility to anti-colonial armed struggle.</p>
<p>Syria agreed to host Fatah and young men from refugee camps were sent there for military training; Iraq also provided facilities and Algeria became a supporter. IDF intelligence didn&rsquo;t regard them as a threat so much as a nuisance.</p>
<p><em>174</em> Israeli plans to divert water from the River Jordan via its national water canal to the Negev desert had led to armed clashes on the Syrian border; Israel&rsquo;s plan to acquire nuclear weapons was also a concern.</p>
<p>In January 1964 Nasser convened a summit of Arab kings and presidents in Cairo declaring the collective goal of the Arab states was the liquidation of Israel and spoke of organising the Palestinians to liberate its country.</p>
<p>The fear was that leaving the cause to the other Arab regimes would lead to the catastrophe of 1948, Haj Amin al-Hussein, leading the old Arab Higher Committee from exile in Beirut was a vocal critic, Arafat too was wary and sent a representative rather than attending himself.</p>
<p><em>175</em> King Hussein was a reluctant host; Jordanian intelligence maintained an intrusive and intimidating presence.</p>
<p>The meeting announced the formation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which reconstituted itself as the Palestine National Council, the PLO&rsquo;s &lsquo;parliament&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The new organisation&rsquo;s charter called for the total liberation of Palestine and self-determination within the borders of the British mandate. It rejected the Balfour declaration, the Mandate system and claims of historical ties between Jews and Palestine, arguing Judaism was a religion and not a nationality.</p>
<p>Arafat kept his distance from this new body, discretely seeking help and training facilities from Syria, Algeria and Jordan.</p>
<p><em>176</em> In 1964 Fatah&rsquo;s first military engagement against Israel was intercepted by Lebanese forces. Three days later it planted an explosive charge in the national water carrier canal in the Bet Netofa valley in lower Galilee. It did not go off but the raid was regarded as a propaganda success.</p>
<p>Their activities unsettled Nasser as potentially marking the trigger point for a military action at the wrong time which would be beyond their control, even as they hailed their successes.</p>
<p><em>177</em> Part of Fatah&rsquo;s strategy was to provoke a reaction which would prompt the intervention of the other Arab states.</p>
<p>Tensions rose as Fatah&rsquo;s attacks continued, Jordan being the most hostile, arresting 200 subversives including most of the PLO staff in Amman. In July Jordanian forces clashed with a Palestinian commando squad on its way to Israel, killing four of them.</p>
<p>In October after a bombing in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Romema district Jordan accepted lists of <em>fedayeen</em> collaborators and arrested them but was also attacked by Israel in November in a punitive attack on Samu, south of Hebron on the West Bank.</p>
<p><em>178</em> This assault left 18 dead, 130 injured, 120 houses destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>1967</strong></p>
<p><em>180</em> Israel&rsquo;s pre-emptive military operation was planned for the end of Egyptian dawn patrols and began with a ground offensive into Gaza and the Sinai, reaching the Suez Canal and Sharm el-Sheikh at the peninsula&rsquo;s southern tip.</p>
<p>Nasser induced Syria and Jordan to launch attacks. Israel had urged King Hussein to stay out of the war retaliated with an offensive to encircle East Jerusalem. Israeli forces initially held back from entering the Old City over religious sensitivities but on 7 June newly appointed minister for defense Moshe Dayan gave the order to attack; Israel conquered the city later that day.</p>
<p>Israeli forces captured Nablus without a shot being fired; IDF units were mistaken for Iraqi reinforcements, Bethlehem fell. When King Hussein ordered his forces to pull back across the Jordan, Israel occupied the rest of the West Bank unopposed. Israel&rsquo;s retaliation against Syria took the form of an air strike which destroyed two-thirds of the Syrian air force, giving them total air superiority.</p>
<p>On 11 June a ceasefire was agreed; Arab losses were over 20,000.</p>
<p>Israel had more than tripled its size and shortened its borders from 983 to 601 km, ruling over 1.1 million Palestinians.</p>
<p>On 27 June the government voted to unite western and eastern parts of Jerusalem, more than doubling municipal jurisdiction to include the newer Arab suburbs and twelve villages, incorporating 69,000 Palestinians and extending to Ramallah in the north and Bethlehem in the south.</p>
<p><em>187</em> Military rule was imposed in these newly annexed areas, banking activities were suspended, financial restrictions, curfews, detention without trial, expulsion and house demolitions under powers put in place by the Brits. Three Palestinian villages, Imwas, Yalu and Beit Nuba were destroyed a week after their inhabitants, expelled to Ramallah, tried to return.</p>
<p><em>189</em> Estimates suggest 200,000 Palestinians displaced; many of these were refugees for a second time, Israel providing transport for them to move east, forcing them to sign documents to the effect that they were doing so willingly.</p>
<p><em>190</em> Gaza&rsquo;s population was densely distributed, mostly urban and young, 65% of them refugees from 1948. Less developed and more isolated than the West Bank, more dependent on Israelis for services and general assistance, weaker institutions.</p>
<p><em>192</em> More difficult for Fatah to operate with blowback potentially attending to the Arab states they worked within; claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded outside the old Fast hotel inside West Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Guerrilla bands of between 10 - 15 operated in the Nablus-Jenin-Tulkarem area and Hebron hills commanded by men who had trained in China and Algeria but the IDF and border police inflicted heavy losses through killings and arrests.</p>
<p><em>193</em> Jordan co-operated with Israel in the running of the West Bank.</p>
<p><em>194</em> Israeli officials liked to present their occupation as enlightened but no resistance was tolerated; curfews, arrests and searches were deployed in response to a school strike over the withdrawal of Arab textbooks; &lsquo;dissidents&rsquo; were often deported.</p>
<p><em>202</em> Debates within Israeli government as to the future of occupation; permanent annexation, granting a new state, settling the area or giving it back to Jordan while retaining control of security.</p>
<p>Ultimately this decision, and discussion with Jordan, was deferred.</p>
<p><strong>1968 - 72</strong></p>
<p><em>207</em> 3,345 dunams of private land in East Jerusalem were cleared for a new Jewish suburb; the first settlement built in occupied territory after the war.</p>
<p><em>208</em> These settlements were slow to expand beyond East Jerusalem, partly for political reasons; Israel argued the West Bank did not constitute occupied territory since Mandatory Palestine had been divided in 1949 and Jordan&rsquo;s unilateral annexation of the West Bank had only been recognised by the Brits and Afghanistan, justified on the basis of the right to return.</p>
<p><em>212</em> In March 1968 Israel launched an attack on Fatah backed by the Jordanian army; despite an ostensible Israeli victory it was a propaganda win for the PLO; the Israelis left a tank and a number of trucks which Arafat and King Hussein photographed themselves with.</p>
<p><em>213</em> Four months later the Palestine National Council allotted seats to the <em>fedayeen</em> groups for the first time.</p>
<p>The PLO&rsquo;s national covenant underwent significant changes in July 1968, emphasising the nationhood of the Palestinians and highlighting armed struggle as the only way to liberation. It also clarified that only Jews who had been living in Palestine before the Zionist invasion could be considered Palestinian; Fatah called for equal right regardless of religion.</p>
<p>In February 1969 Arafat became chairman of the PLO executive committee.</p>
<p><em>215</em> Support for the <em>fedayeen</em> grew in the West Bank as support for Jordanian loyalists fell; the new universities founded in the area created a new politically conscious generation.</p>
<p><em>216</em> In 1971 the <em>fedayeen</em> struggle reached its peak in the Gaza Strip, numbers were swelled by fighters fleeing escalating attacks on the PLO in Jordan; killings of Palestinians regarded as collaborators were common. Weapons stockpiled during Egyptian rule were gathered, others were smuggled in from Sinai, orange groves provided natural cover for guerrillas.</p>
<p>Sharon led a brutal counter-insurgency campaign, imposing 24 hour curfews and a shoot-to-kill policy. Roads were cleared through Gaza&rsquo;s biggest refugee camps, about 100,000 people had been forced to find new homes by mid 1971.</p>
<p><em>218</em> This repression forced Palestinian resistance abroad.</p>
<p>King Hussein became worried about the future of his regime with PLO presence increasing and Fatah mounting 200 operations a month from Jordan, clamped down on the Palestinians but then agreed an armistice with Arafat.</p>
<p>In September 1970 the PFLP hijacked three civilian airliners and blew them up in the kingdom and Hussein declared martial law, PLO forces were routed and driven out of the country, between 3 - 5000 Palestinians and 600 Jordanians were forced out fo the country.</p>
<p>In October 1970 King Hussein met the Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Yigal Allon promising to prevent further <em>fedayeen</em> raids. 3 - 5,000 Palestinian fighters fled to Lebanon, another 2,300 were taken prisoner. 72 surrendered to the Israelis rather than fight the Jordanians.</p>
<p><strong>1973 - 77</strong></p>
<p><em>226</em> On 6 October 1973 Egyptian and Syrian offensives along the Suez Canal and Golan Heights triggered air strikes, artillery duels and tank battles. Israel was caught unprepared by the breaching of its Bar-Lev line east of the canal and initial Egyptian advances in Sinai.</p>
<p>Mobilisation of IDF reserves turned the tide; when a UN-brokered ceasefire was introduced on 14 October Israeli forces were fifty miles from Cairo and twenty-five from Damascus; the entire Egpytian Third Army were encircled by the IDF on the Eastern bank of the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>A general strike took place in the occupied territories, Palestinian Liberation Army troops were deployed in a limited capacity on both fronts but the majority of Palestinians played no role, nor did Jordan.</p>
<p><em>227</em> Israel suffered 2,650 losses, their largest since 1948, Egypt and Syria together lost 16,000.</p>
<p>The war had been launched by Sadat and Hafez al-Assad with the limited goal of challenging the post-67 settlement. The Egyptian president hoped to impose a peace settlement, Assad was anxious to liberate the Golan Heights and was slightly more committed to the cause. Egypt regained territory, Syria did not.
At the Algiers Arab summit conference in November 1973 all twenty-one Arab states recognised the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>In the UN two weeks later Arafat offered &rsquo;the gun or the olive branch&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>234</em> In May 1977 Menachem Begin&rsquo;s Likud, an alliance of the right wing Herut party and the liberals emerged as the largest party in the general election after a campaign focused on allegations of incompetence surrouding Yitzhak Rabin&rsquo;s government after the Yom Kippur war.</p>
<p>Begin was remembered as the leader of the Irgun, perpetrator of the bombing of the King David Hotel and the Deir Yassin massacre; his election indicated the increasingly rightist direction of travel, settlements would be expanded under him.</p>
<p><em>238</em> This expansion of settlements meant more confiscation of Palestinian land, more water under Israeli control, the extension of Israeli law.</p>
<p><em>239</em> The number of settlers in the West Bank rose to 12,500 by 1980, with a view to Balkanising it out of existence. New settlements were built by Palestinians, making them an indispensible part of the labour force, even while social intercourse propert was limited.</p>
<p><strong>1977 - 81</strong></p>
<p><em>241</em> In November 1977 Sadat flew from Cairo to Tel Aviv and signed a peace treaty with the Israelis, on the principle of returning land to Egypt of all territory it had lost to Israel in 67 except the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p><em>242</em> This was a crushing blow to the PLO.</p>
<p><em>243</em> Arafat condemned Sadat but did not join a radical Arab bloc of Stria, Algeria, South Yemen and Libya which cut all ties with Egypt.</p>
<p><em>244</em> On 25 December 1977 Begin visited Ismailiya on the Suez Canal, Cairo being deemed too hostile an environment. Carter called on Begin to recognise the rights of Palestinians and the prospects of talks receded.</p>
<p>Shortly after a squad of thirteen Fatah men landed on a deserted beach in Haifa and killed thirty-eight Israeli civilians.</p>
<p><em>245</em> Three days later Israel sent 25,000 troops into Lebanon to push Palestinian fighters away from the border and bolster their local proxy the South Lebanon Army (SLA). Seven days of fighting ended with a ceasefire, with 1,100 people killed, mostly Palestinian and Lebanese. Between 100,000 and 250,000 people were displaced.</p>
<p>Sadat and Begin visited Washington in summer 1978 but relations worsened. In September Carter brought the two to Camp David in Maryland.</p>
<p><em>246</em> After two weeks agreement on removal of military bases from the Sinai was reached and normalisation of relations would occur, Sadat would receive $1.3 billion of annual US aid to the Egyptian armed forces.</p>
<p>A Second Camp David document agreed future negotiations would be based on UN Resolution 242 but the PLO was not entioned.</p>
<p><em>247</em> Palestinian opposition hardened, Jordan declined to join talks on a self-governing authority, West Bank mayors were dismissive that autonomy would mean a change from the status quo.</p>
<p>A National Guidance Committee was formed in November 1978 representing and co-ordinating Palestinian trade unions and student body resistance. Fatah was part of this 23 member body but did not dominate it.</p>
<p>Following the signing of the Egyptian accord the biggest protest strike in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 took place.</p>
<p><em>251</em> Begin&rsquo;s second term as prime minister began in August 1981; changes to occupation policy included a separate civilian administration in the West Bank and Gaza, which would be subordinate to the military government. Division of labour was designed to pre-empt the outcome of autonomy talks with Egypt by implementing Israel&rsquo;s interpretation of Camp David unilaterally.</p>
<p><em>252</em> The head of the new administration Menachem Milson was a professor who bolstered the Israeli-backed Village Leagues which had been established to counter the influence of the PLO in the cities, on the basis that the conservative rural sector, 70% of the West Bank&rsquo;s population, would be easier to influence.</p>
<p>Palestinians were hostile but Jordan&rsquo;s decision to ban membership of the Leagues on pain of death and confiscation of property was decisive.</p>
<p><strong>1982 - 87</strong></p>
<p><em>260</em> In September 1982 Reagan unveiled a plan for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, creating an entity that would be linked to Jordan.</p>
<p>It also called for a freeze on settlements and Palestinian responsibility for internal security.</p>
<p><em>268</em> In February 1986 Hussein broke with Arafat and the Israelis allowed Palestinians to take over from IDF officers who had been running West Bank town halls since mayors had been sacked in 1982. The scion of a prominent local family took the job but was assassinated.</p>

			<description>When reading Sally Rooney’s novels I wonder whether or not she is doing the same thing as Joanna Hogg or Harmony Korine, wherein something vacuous and / or vulgar is being represented as a comment on societal vulgarity and vacuousness or whether those being represented, whether upper-class English people or lower-class Americans, are intended to be in and of themselves, sympathetic or interesting.

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When reading Sally Rooney’s novels I wonder whether or not she is doing the same thing as Joanna Hogg or Harmony Korine, wherein something vacuous and / or vulgar is being represented as a comment on societal vulgarity and vacuousness or whether those being represented, whether upper-class English people or lower-class Americans, are intended to be in and of themselves, sympathetic or interesting. The answer is always both, but I think Beautiful World Where Are You represents a turning point in Rooney’s writing career at which the central point is indeed that we find academically high-achieving and precocious people who attended Trinity College Dublin sympathetic and interesting.</p>
<p>There are at least four distinct narrative modes within this novel.</p>
<p>i. mimetic depictions of how characters sit, where they are looking, what’s on their phone screen, how they hang their clothes up or don’t, whether or not they uncoil the cables of phone chargers. These sections are more surface than depth. Nothing is, rather they appear or suggest; there is a constitutive tenativeness at work here, especially in instances in which someone appearing to be nonchalant as a pretense to feeling some other way would be of little or no consequence.</p>
<p>ii. sections in which Eileen and Alice, the two central characters, send emails to one another, discussing relationships, both former and prior, reflect on how they feel, how they appear to themselves, how they appear to others and how others appear to them. Into this come also the novels’ ideas, such as right-wing politics, civilisational collapse and the felt biological need to have babies. The extended treatment of ideas at length represent a difference from previous works; Frances and Bobbi’s intellectual or politics interests in Conversations with Friends were exclusively a function of having scandalous things to say in company.</p>
<p>iii. dialogue.</p>
<p>iv. retrospective exposition. To paraphrase; ‘Eileen’s sister played sports at school’, ‘Alice and Eileen would eat toast together long into the night’, ‘Eileen won all the academic prizes for which she was eligible’. This is only mode in which the reader moves back and forth in time.</p>
<p>Though self-consciousness is common to ii. and iii. and ideas come through in dialogue as well as emails I would not suggest that we are in the territory of free indirect discourse. Instead there is a more or less absolute cordon sanitaire cleaving one from the other. This is not to the works’ benefit, read alone the clunkiness present in ii. is undeniable:</p>
<p>‘My theory is that human beings lost the instinct for beauty in 1976 when plastics became the most widespread material in existence. You can actually see the change in process if you look at street photography from before and after 1976. I know we have good reason to be sceptical of aesthetic nostalgia but the fact remains that before the 1970’s people wore durable clothes of wool and cotton, stored drinks in glass bottles, wrapped food produce in paper and filled their houses with sturdy wooden furniture. Now the majority of objects in our visual environment is made of plastic, the ugliest substance on earth. A material which, when dyed does not assume colour but rather exudes colour in an inimitability ugly way. One thing a government could do…is to prohibit the production of every form of plastic not necessary for the maintenance of human life’.</p>
<p>This paragraph and others would prompt me to think that we are firmly in the territory of Korine-Hogg, that the Kantian readings of social relations or human history are intended to transgress against our attention, or, as other critics have suggested, keep those who have showed up for the sex, or didn’t think Marxism was cool a decade ago at arms-length, given that the Anglo-American novel is in something of a golden age in terms of the number of ideas about late capitalism or modernity being ventriloquised, as in autofiction, essay fiction, theory fiction, creative non-fiction, whatever we want to call it. Whatever we might think of these works – and their class biases, originality and elitism have been litigated in many articles and reviews – I think its fair to say that one of their distinguishing features are their success in dovetailing the fictive and non-fictive with a certain amount of formal elegance.</p>
<p>Splitting the boundaries between these distinct modes might have allowed for a greater amount of resolution in both, or pointed a way beyond the relentless struggle within each character’s minds between politics and individuality such that they may not need to be led towards the submission and sacrifice available to them in Catholicism. This turn is interesting to read at a time in which reproductive rights are increasingly a political flashpoint. Lauren Oyler, in a recent article in the London Review of Books, seems to despair of the growth of a counter-cultural Catholicism and though no doubt numerically negligible it’s still not nearly as rare as I would like, particularly in Ireland. The implicit contention in Beautiful World Where Are You that Jesus is a bit Marxist while jettisoning everything that makes the established Catholic Church what it is cursory, and unconvincing. Allowing the emails to speak more to the novel’s matter might also have done for its non-specificity, there is an email that considers the topography of Dublin’s relative freedom from architectural fedual remnants and whether or not this makes its topography more democratic than those on the continent. Even within the context of the novel itself this is a mad thing to say, the scandal of Dublin’s rental market is represented and compared unfavourably to Paris. The apocalypticism of right-wing politics are a frequent touchstone but a reference to a British politician making an offensive statement on Bloody Sunday remains just that.</p>
<p>In each of Rooney’s novels the supposed disagreeableness and fervency of particular characters will comfortably alongside their popularity and brilliance. I look forward to seeing if Rooney will try to introduce a greater amount of friction between these two poles in her future works.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Chapter One: The Global Commodity</strong></p>
<p><em>12</em> Companies based in the West such as Walmart, M&amp;S, Primark have gone to enormous efforts to offshore textile production to Bangladesh in pursuit of lower labour costs. According to trade and financial data however, none of these firms profits or government revenues derived from the labour of the workers who made the goods.</p>
<p>All the goods appear as &lsquo;value-added&rsquo; in the UK and other countries where these goods are consumed. As a consequence, each item of clothing expands the GDP of the country it is consumed in by far more than the country in which it is produced.  to such efforts to offshore textile production to Bangladesh.</p>
<p><strong>The T-Shirt</strong></p>
<p><em>13</em> In <em>The China Price</em> Tony Norfield outlines that the enormous profits Western companies such as H&amp;M make are in turn dwarfed by the state&rsquo;s cut of income tax and VAT.</p>
<p><em>14</em> <em>&lsquo;Wage rates in Bangladesh are particularly low, but even the multiples of these seen in other poor countries point to the same conclusion: oppression of workers in poorer countries is a direct economic benefit for the mass of people in the richer countries&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Outsourcing, or the Globalisation of Production</strong></p>
<p><em>41</em> Global outsourcing begins in the sixties and seventies, with the movement of production jobs in shoes, clothing toys and the assembly of electronics to low-wage countries, assisting Tesco, Walmart and others in establishing the supremacy of commercial capital in consumer goods markets.</p>
<p>This shift in the balance of power to the benefit of commercial capitalists increases pressure on producer monopolies to de-unionise and flexibilise their domestic labour force, outsourcing labour-intensive production regimes to low-wage countries.</p>
<p>These profits are re-distributed from industrial to commercial capitalists and passed on to sections of the western working class in the form of falling prices of consumer goods.</p>
<p><em>42</em> The outsourcing of the tech industry was also determined by competition between USian and Japanese companies. Outsourcing to Taiwan and South Korea radically reduced US production costs. These economies are often referred to as &rsquo;newly industrialising&rsquo; which is misleading; it is the most labour-intensive parts of the production process which are being transferred overseas.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on Trade Statistics</strong></p>
<p><em>43</em> Trade statistics double-count imported inputs: Bangladesh&rsquo;s earnings from garment exports include the cost of the imported texiles that Bangladeshi garment workers fashion into clothes. As the share of intermediate inputs in total trade increases this distortion grows larger and statisticians in the WTO and the OECD have had to develop new analytical tools and datasets to account for this distortion.</p>
<p>The UNCTAD&rsquo;s 2013 <em>World Investment Report</em> estimates that ~28% (5 trillion dollars of 19 trillion in 2010 figures) of gross exports consist of value added that is first imported by countries to be incorporated into products or services which are then exported again, i.e. they are double-counted.</p>
<p><strong>Outsourcing and the Reproduction of Labour-Power in Imperialist Nations</strong></p>
<p><em>45</em> Outsourcing replaces higher-paid domestic labour with lower-paid Southern labour in the global south, exposing workers in imperialist nations to competition with southern nations while falling prices of clothing, food and other articles of mass consumption protects consumption levels from falling wages, magnifying the effects of wage increases.</p>
<p>In <em>World Economic Outlook 2007</em>, the IMF reports:</p>
<p><em>Although the labour share [of GDP] went down, globalisation of labour as manifested in cheaper imports in advanced countries has increased the &lsquo;size of the pie&rsquo; to be shared among all citizens, resulting in a net gain in total workers&rsquo; compensation in real terms&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>Cost savings from outsourcing therefore benefit workers in imperialist countries. This is an economic imperative for the capitalist classes in the west but is also a political strategy in pursuit of industrial peace.</p>
<p><strong>The Globalisation of Production Processes</strong></p>
<p><em>46</em> In the early stages of the industrial revolution, before the widespread introduction of power machinery, the processing of raw materials into goods usually took place in a single factory. Mechanisation spurred concentration and specialisation, fostering growth within national borders of more complex production networks.</p>
<p>For two centuries global trade consisted of raw materials and final goods. Production in the neoliberal epoch extended the links in the chains of production and value-creation across national borders, increasing the role of intermediate goods in international trade either within firms through Foreign Direct Investment or sub-contracting.</p>
<p><em>47</em> This is often omitted from mainstream trade statistics, which omit the export of intermediate inputs to low-wage nations for final assembly as well as finished goods destined for consumption by workers. The pace and extent of globalisation is therefore hugely under-estimated.</p>
<p><em>48 - 9</em> One way we can get an idea of the extent of outsourcing and offshoring relationships is to analyse manufactured exports from low-wage nations to imperial nations as a whole, which have more than tripled between 1980 and 2016.</p>
<p>In a study published by UNCTAD in 2013 Rashmi Banga found that 67% of the total value-add generated in global value chains is captured by firms in rich nations.</p>
<p><em>50</em> Transnational corporations are the prime movers of production&rsquo;s globalisation, the UNCTAD estimate that 80% of global trade (in terms of gross exports) is linked to the international production networks of TNCs.</p>
<p><strong>Services and the Globalisation of Production</strong></p>
<p><em>57</em> Mainstream conceptions of globalisation focuses exclusively on manufacturing and ignores services, regarding the later as a weightless, intangible commodity.</p>
<p><strong>Productive and Non-Productive Labour</strong></p>
<p><em>60</em> Marxist value theory maintains economic activities which are not integral but contingent to the production process, such as banking, finance, police and security services, government bureaucracies make no net addition to social wealth; they produce no value, they are forms of social consumption of values elsewhere and are hence non-productive.</p>
<p><em>61</em> We need to update our view of services in line with Marx&rsquo;s perspective. Marx&rsquo;s view of transportation is that it does not alter the form of the commodity, but only its position.</p>
<p>Financial services and other non-productive, rent-seeking activities which have come to debate the economics of the West have a smaller weight in the Global South (and are in any case largely dominated by Western TNCs).</p>
<p><em>62</em> Mainstream economists equate value with value add, which erases exploitation and erases the distinction between productive and non-productive labour. If every price is value then any activity that leads to a sale is productive.</p>
<p><em>63</em> In reality the social wealth consumed by non-productive labourers is derived from surplus labour (labour performed in excess of necessary labour) produced by productive labourers.</p>
<p>The distinction between necessary and surplus labour time exists in all modes of production; under feudalism it records the days the serf toils on the lord&rsquo;s land as opposed to their own, under capitalism it represents the extension of the workday beyond the time needed to replace the value of the basket of goods for which they exchange their wage.</p>
<p>The ratio of surplus to necessary labour - the rate of surplus value - is equal to the rate of exploitation.</p>
<p>This rate can go up by the reduction of wages and it can go down as the number of workers in non-productive sectors increase, which has been the case in Western economies over the past half-century. This puts the onus on TNCs to increase the exploitation of the workforce.</p>
<p>If workers in finance, advertising and security produce no value, are they exploited? As long as workers are required to work for longer than the labour-time required to produce their basket of consumption goods, yes they are. This is independent of the specific way their labour is employed or what sector they work in, whether production, circulation or administration.</p>
<p>We therefore assume all these works endure the nationally prevailing rate of exploitation in common with production labour.</p>
<p>Nonproductive sectors are sustained by part of the surplus value extracted in production; the values consumed by them subtract what is available for profit.</p>
<p><strong>Services and the Productivity Paradox</strong></p>
<p><em>64</em> Many service tasks are labour-intensive and are difficult to mechanise, leading to what appears to be stagnant or falling levels of labour productivity in the service sector, as happened in the education, health, auto repair and legal sectors between 1977 to 1997,</p>
<p>By contrast, the rate of productivity growth in manufacturing accounted for the most overall productivity growth in the US economy, releasing labour for redeployment to service jobs or the unemployed, resulting in a relative decline in manufacturing&rsquo;s contribution to GDP.</p>
<p>The more rapidly labour productivity grows in industry, the more important that industry becomes in sustaining the rest of the economy and society. But this means that industry&rsquo;s share of GDP and total employment diminishes. This is what lies behind the discourse regarding &lsquo;post-industrial society&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>65</em> While some productive increases are due to intensification of the labour process and the introduction of labour-saving technology, some of it is due to the externalisation of service tasks, i.e. an industrial firm sub-contracting out labour-intensive services such as cleaning. This raises productivity per unit even if nothing else changes as there is no a smaller workforce.</p>
<p>Outsourcing services overseas raises productivity even more as wage costs have been slashed. This is an enormous part of the reason behind productivity gains.</p>
<p><em>66</em> This export-oriented strategy former colonies have pursued were forced on them by international financial institutions, academics and western governments. This has been a conscious strategy employed by Western capitalists to disrupt union organisation and repress wages.</p>
<p>This wage disparity also generates migration of low-wage workers to Western nations; outsourcing and migration are therefore two aspects of the same process.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: The Two Forms of the Outsourcing Relationship</strong></p>
<p><em>68</em> Production outsourcing takes two basic forms:</p>
<p>i) foreign direct investment, where the production process is moved over-seas but kept in-house
ii) arms-length outsourcing, when a firm outsourcing part or all of the production process to an independent supplier, independent in the sense that the lead firm owns none of it but controls its activities.</p>
<p>Mainstream economists and Marxists have tended to over-rate the significance of FDI because it is the most easily accessible phenomenon from an empirical perspective, but the growth of the latter form renders this approach increasingly anachronistic.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Direct Investment</strong></p>
<p><em>70 - 1</em> FDI can be categorised into four separate types:</p>
<p>i) Efficiency seeking: FDI&rsquo;s paradigmatic form - outsourcing in order to cut costs</p>
<p>ii) Market-seeking: dominant form in the years before the neoliberal epoch, devised when protectionist barriers required TNCs to move production close to markets - this is the form FDI assumed in Ireland in the postwar era. In contrast to efficiency-seeking FDI this form does not involve the fragmentation of productive processes but their replication in the host country.</p>
<p>iii) Resource-seeking: foreign investment in extractive industries such as hydrocarbons and minerals, but also foodstuffs, ingredients for cosmetics and much else. At arms-length sub-contracting is less evident here because the collection of rents from rich deposits is more straightforward when the lead firm owns the resources.</p>
<p>iv) Technology-seeking FDI: seeks access to scientific or technological knowledge available in the host location.</p>
<p><em>72</em> Again we would misunderstand this process looking at mainstream statistics: the extent to which FDI flows between imperialist countries is over-stated by non-productive investments in finance and business, the degree to which it is made up of the accelerating concentration of capital in the form of mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>The Profits of FDI</strong></p>
<p><em>76</em> FDI going from the West to the West and from the West to the South cannot be equated.  Flows of investment and repatriated profit between the US, Europe and Japan are symmetrical, in that they invest in each other, whereas cross-border investment between the Global South and the West are extremely asymmetrical.</p>
<p><strong>The Mysteries of Outsourcing</strong></p>
<p><em>80 - 1</em> One reason arms-length outsourcing is more profitable than FDI is that TNCs pay their employees better than local companies do.</p>
<p>Wages in middle-income country TNCs are 80% than those paid by local employers, 100% in low-income countries.</p>
<p>It also externalises direct responsibility for pollution, poverty wages and suppression of trade unions.</p>
<p><em>82</em> Increased profits achieved via outsourcing are are not invested in production at home or as FDI and can be vdevoted to leveraging asset values through stock buybacks and generous dividens payments or invested in financial markets to reap speculative profits. Avoidance of FDI in favour of arms-length therefore releases funds for investments and stock buybacks.</p>
<p><strong>The Structure of World Trade</strong></p>
<p><em>84</em> Northern firms do not compete with Southern firms but compete with other Northern firms in order to outsource production to low-wage countries. Southern firms compete with each other to sell cheap labour to leading northern firms. N-S competition, when compared with N-N competition or S-S competition is insignificant.</p>
<p><strong>The Index of Complexity</strong></p>
<p><em>86 - 7</em> The index of complexity is a measure of the exclusivity and diversity of an economy&rsquo;s component parts, diversity being the number of products a country exports with a &lsquo;revealed comparative advantage&rsquo;, that is, where the country has specialised in what it does best at the expense of others.</p>
<p><em>88</em> Broad consensus that the loss of competitiveness by peripheral countries in the Eurozone viz. Germany and other core nations is behind the present crisis in the EU:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Unable to restore their competitiveness through currency devaluation, their only option is savage cuts in nominal wages, including that part of it received in the form of social wages&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Assymmetric Market Structures: Monopolistic &lsquo;Lead Firms&rsquo; in the North, Cutthroat Competition in the South</strong></p>
<p><em>91</em> The Index of Complexity&rsquo;s shows:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;richer countries are the major exporters of the more complex products while the poorer countries are the major exporters of less complex products&hellip;developing country exports tend to be increasingly concentrated in&hellip;labour-intensive production processes&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>This is another reason why countries in the global South do not compete with those of the Global North.</p>
<p>The race among developing nations to export more dynamic products will more than offset the marginal gains - this inculcates a &lsquo;race to the bottom&rsquo; dynamic.</p>
<p>The success of the first Newly Industrialising Countries (South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore) seemed to show the path for other poor and underdeveloped nations</p>
<p><em>92</em> The only way for one of these nations to escape this is erecting a barrier to competition, some form of monopoly, against the prevailing notions of how international trade works.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Growth in the South&rsquo;s Share of Global Manufacturing Value Added</strong></p>
<p><em>95</em> The long-running decline in Manufacturing Value Added (MVA)&rsquo;s share of GDP in imperialist nations is interpreted as indicating a declining importance for manufacturing, in favour of a knowledge economy or post-industrial society, while they have actually been exported. Industry&rsquo;s contribution to GDP is far greater than the statistics indicate; manufacturing is the source of value consumed by non-productive sectors and misread as their contribution to GDP.</p>
<p><em>96</em> We have seen that this is a consequence of capitalists seeking to replace workers with machines or lower-wage workers in the global south: increasing productivity and fewer workers giving the misleading impression that industry is declining in importance as society is becoming more complicated with fewer workers.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Southern Labour, Peripheral No Longer</strong></p>
<p><em>102</em> As a consequence of these off-shoring activities, 83% of the world&rsquo;s manufacturing workforce lives and works in the Global South, not only becoming more numerous but becoming more integrated into the global economy, magnifying their importance and social weight.</p>
<p><strong>Informalisation and Social Retrogression</strong></p>
<p><em>118</em> This greater degree of integration fuelling a larger and larger reserve army of labour</p>
<p><em>119</em> Formal labour markets unable to absorb millions of self-employed, casual, sub-contract, temporary and part-time workers; this too has been a policy dictated by World Bank structural adjustment programmes, part of a worldwide anti-labour offensive.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Global Wage Trends in the Neoliberal Era</strong></p>
<p><em>133</em> Data on wages needs to be handled very carefully, not least because of the distortion introduced by market exchange rates, buying power differing by jurisdiction.</p>
<p><em>145 - 6</em> Smith introduces the labour share of national income on this basis, its continuous decline over the past fifty years is one of the most noteworthy feature of the neoliberal epoch.</p>
<p>Labour share = ratio of total employees&rsquo; compensation (pre-tax wages and salaries + employers&rsquo; national insurance and other social contributions) to total national income.</p>
<p>*Wages are recorded pre-tax because it is assumed that workers receive benefits in exchange for and equal to the taxes they pay to the state. In this sense the state adds no value, which Smith uses as an example of the biases built into bourgeois economics.</p>
<p>Indirect taxes, insofar as they are paid out of labour income, automatically count towards labour share. Resultantly, most of the fraction of GDP that accrues to the state is counted towards labour share, even that part which funds foreign wars, services the soverign debt.</p>
<p>In this way decreasing labour share of income is regarded as its opposite.</p>
<p>Other distorting influences include stock options, super-wages, bonuses, benefits paid to employers and managers.</p>
<p><em>148</em> According to the ILO&rsquo;s <em>World of Work Report 2011</em>, share of domestic income to labour declined in almost three-quarters of 69 countries with available information, this decline is generally more pronounced in emerging and developing countries than advanced ones.</p>
<p><em>158</em> Huge wage differentials can be observed between the north and south and this trend persists when we break them down by sector.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6: The Purchasing Power Anomaly and the Productivity Paradox</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Productivity Paradox</strong></p>
<p><em>174</em> Statistics on labour productivity, obtained by dividing the value added in a firm, industrial sector or nation by its total workforce are highly deceptive. Much of the increase in imperialist nations arise as a consequence of the outsourcing of low value-added, labour-intensive production processes to low-wage countries.</p>
<p>As detailed above, this is because the size of the workforce under consideration has been reduced.</p>
<p><em>175</em> There is therefore a &lsquo;ventriloquist effect&rsquo;. The more labour-intensive a production process is, the larger living labour is deployed in relation to dead labour, much of this is captured by capital-intensive capitals, showing a much higher value add per worker.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity, Industry and Services</strong></p>
<p>As discussed above: service tasks are labour-intensive and less susceptible to productivity-enhancing capital investments; labour productivity advances much faster in industry, which exhibits a tendency towards relative decline in employment.</p>
<p>The faster labour productivity in manufacturing advances the more rapidly its contribution to GDP declines.</p>
<p><em>176 - 7</em> Important to distinguish between the bourgeois conception of productivity versus Marx&rsquo;s understanding: the use-value of a pencil is the same today as two centuries ago (or higher due to superior lead etc.), yet the quantity of labour necessary to produce one is many magnitudes smaller.</p>
<p>In terms of use-values there has been a colossal leap of producitivty, but considered from the point of view of exchange-value, it is moot whether producitivty has grown.</p>
<p>From society&rsquo;s point of view the quantity of use-values is decisive, but capitalists are only interested in how much they can be sold for.</p>
<p>Productivity can also not be compared across sectors. As Marx says:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Productivity&hellip;naturally ceases to have any bearing on that labour as soon as we abstract it from its concrete useful form&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>This is the core of Marx&rsquo;s understanding of value and the commodity, containing a contradiction between use and exchange value.</p>
<p>Under capitalism, productivity = the amount of value-add that can be harvested for each unit of value paid in wages. If wages are cut and everything remains the same, labour becomes more productive by default, despite producing no additional use values.</p>
<p><em>178</em> To a Marxist this definition of productivity is the rate of exploitation. According to the logic of capital: the more workers are exploited, the more productive they are. This is also called Unit Labour Cost (ULC), which is significantly lower in Southern than Northern Countries.</p>
<p><em>186</em> Bourgeois economists attempt to obfuscate this higher degree of exploitation by insisting that there are international differences re: the productivity of labour, the marginalist theory of value, against which Marx&rsquo;s theory of value as dual in character must be posited.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7: Global Labour Arbitrage: The Key Driver of the Globalisation of Production</strong></p>
<p><strong>Global Labour Arbitrage and Marxist Theories of Globalisation and Imperialism</strong></p>
<p><em>196 - 7</em> The rate of exploitation or the rate of surplus value can be increased by lengthening the working day (increasing absolute surplus value) or reducing the value of labour-power (increasing relative surplus value).</p>
<p>Relative surplus value can be increased in three ways:</p>
<p>i) raising the productivity of labour in the branches of production involved in the production of workers&rsquo; consumption goods, thereby reducing the amount of labour time needed to produce the basket of goods consumed by the worker and her/his family.</p>
<p>ii) lowering the real wage by reducing consumption (i.e. the size of the basket of goods)</p>
<p>iii) reduction of wages below the value of labour power</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Marxists and the Global Labour Arbitrage</strong></p>
<p><em>199</em> David Harvey argues that the overaccumulation of capital forces capitalists to increasingly depend on non-capitalist forms of exploitation, rather than extracting surplus value via waged labour, social welfare regimes are privatised, communal property is confiscated.</p>
<p><em>200</em> He calls this accumulation via dispossession.</p>
<p>Smith charges Harvey and Ellen Mieksens Wood who also writes on contemporary imperialism with missing what is most characteristic about imperialism in the present epoch, namely, the global operation of the law of value and the exploitation of waged labourers in the global south.</p>
<p><em>203</em> Brenner is also criticised for failing to recognise that the excess capacity in the global economy is a consequence of imperialist economies seeking to contain over-production by shifting low value-add production overseas.</p>
<p><em>205 - 7</em> Samir Amin&rsquo;s notion that there is a single value associated with labour-power and that it should be understood globally is criticised on the basis that it is suppresses the uneven qualities of the global labour market. [Amin is later criticised on <em>215</em> for upholding Stalin&rsquo;s analysis of national liberation struggles, recommending the working class in the Global South ally with their indigenous bourgeoisie]</p>
<p><strong>Dependency Theory and International Differences in the Rate of Exploitation</strong></p>
<p>Dependency theory first arose among Latin American, Asian and African economists, academics, reformists, activists and revolutionaries in the sixties and seventies seeking to explain the persistence of imperial domination of the global economy following the collapse of territorial empires. Smith represents this as the best means of analysing imperialism according to Marx&rsquo;s theory of value, despite the fact that it arose before neoliberalism; when developing countries exported raw materials and imported manufactured goods.</p>
<p>The rapid export-oriented industrial development seen in South Korea, China and Singapore in the seventies at first seemed to undermine dependency theory&rsquo;s legitimacy.</p>
<p><strong>Unequal Exchange</strong></p>
<p><em>208</em> Two economists Raúl Prebisch and Hans Singer separately devised what is now known as the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, the notion that there is a long-run tendency for commodity exporters to suffer deteriorating terms of trade with manufactured goods-exporting rich nations and that this reduced or cancels the benefits of comparative advantge for primary commodity-exporting countries, perpetuating their underdevelopment and widening the gap between them and developed countries and smith argues that empirical evidence has borne this prediction out.</p>
<p>This contradicts Bukharin&rsquo;s prediction for the tendency of raw material prices to rise, on the basis that the development of agriculture lags behind the development of industry. The rate of profit rises and falls in inverse ratio to fluctuations in the price of raw materials</p>
<p>Presbisch-Singer theorised that declining terms of trade of raw materials stems from the asymmetric structure of the global economy and specifically the different properties intrinsic to the production of raw materials viz. manufactured goods, i.e. that the prices of raw materials fluctuate to a much greater extent.</p>
<p>A pre-condition of capitalist development is therefore to move from a dependence on agriculture and resource extraction to modern industry, which is only possible if indigenous industry can be protected from foreign competition through an Import Substitution Strategy (ISI).</p>
<p><em>209</em> In sum: for poor countries to become developed capitalist nations the state has to intervene to protect domestic industry from competition, a view and strategy which is perfectly compatible with the interests of a domestic capital owning class, which became highly influential among developmental agencies.</p>
<p>A cohort of Marxist thinkers also engaged with dependency theory to bolster an economic analysis of anti-imperialist revolutions in Cuba and China, but these were divided due to alternating allegiances to Moscow or Beijing; when Cuba was isolated dependency theorists were cut off from the most advanced debates regarding the law of value, imperialism and the socialist transition.</p>
<p>Cuba fought with the Soviet Union and other Comecon states to develop the first example of fair trade between industrialised and developing nations, based on fixing prices to ensure commodities were exchanged based on equal quantities of labour, taking the edge off the law of value.</p>
<p><em>211</em> The partial rolling back of this arrangement by incorporating Cuba fully into the Comecon states in 1973 were a disaster later condemned by Fidel.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency&rsquo;s Euro-Marxist Critics</strong></p>
<p><em>219 - 20</em> In rejecting dependency theory Marxists such as Weeks and Dore argue that because productivity levels in imperialist countries are higher, workers in imperialist countries are more exploited, despite their higher levels of consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8: Imperialism and the Law of Value</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lenin and Imperialism</strong></p>
<p><em>225</em> Lenin&rsquo;s <em>Imperialism, the Highest State of Capitalism</em> outlines that imperialism was an expression of capitalism and not an historical coincidence and thereby rendered in central to anti-capitalist strategy.</p>
<p><em>226</em> Lenin&rsquo;s vision of imperialism&rsquo;s role in the production of value was by necessity limited as this phenomenon only emerged at later stages in capitalism&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>Ellen Mieksins Wood therefore mis-represents Lenin when says Lenin&rsquo;s notion of imperialism depended on pre-capitalist forms and instruments (such as territorial expansion, military force, etc.), these were fixtures of the political moment at the time Lenin was writing.</p>
<p><em>228</em> Describes Harvey&rsquo;s attempt to fill the vaccuum left by his rejection of Lenin with &lsquo;spatiotemporal dynamics&rsquo; as &lsquo;vacuous&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Monopoly Capitalism</strong></p>
<p>Other critics of Lenin have dismissed his theory of the centrality of imperialism to capital accumulation on the basis of his argument that imperialism is indistinguishable from monopoly capitalism.</p>
<p><em>229</em> Smith notes that the term monopoly is deployed to describe phenomena relating to production, distribution, brand loyalty, finance, concentration of capital, technological innovations, extra-economic distortions, tariff, etc.</p>
<p><em>230</em> Smith defines monopoly as:</p>
<p><em>&rsquo;the extent to which imperfections in markets result in equilibrium prices that do not equalise the rate of profit, enabling some capitalists to claim super-profits at the expense of their rivals&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>This affects the division of surplus value between competing capitals. Monopoly over most advanced production techniques does result in above average profits for innovative firms; these forms of monopoly are constantly created and destroyed by competition in each branch and sphere of production. A technological innovation can become an insurmountable obstacle when an innovator is given legal monopoly over its use. Another form of monopoly is the enormous size of capital investments required for new firms to enter markets for many high-technology goods.</p>
<p>In both of these cases monopoly power is not determined by the technological innovation or the capital as such but the way it functions in the marketplace.</p>
<p><em>231</em> Distinguishing technological innovation from monopoly allows rent and imperialist rent to be seen as distributional phenomena; to do with how surplus value is distributed between owners of capital and remote from the production process itself.</p>
<p>For Lenin monopoly was the merging of financial and industrial capital and both of these with the state. Imperialist power makes itself clear in control of markets, advanced technology, state and military power.</p>
<p><strong>The Export of Capital</strong></p>
<p><em>232</em> Applying Lenin&rsquo;s analysis of imperialism today is difficult because though capital is still exported through FDI, purchases of financial securities and loan capital, arms-length production processes have become much more important.</p>
<p>Smith squares this with his defense of Lenin&rsquo;s theory by saying Lenin put the export of capital forward as one form imperialist parasitism takes. The essence of the relationship from Lenin&rsquo;s point of view is that capitalists in imperialist nations seek to convert of their surplus wealth into capital by exploiting subject peoples overseas; this continues to be the case.</p>
<p><strong>Marx&rsquo;s Capital in the Twenty-First Century</strong></p>
<p><em>236</em> Arguing against a tendency assumed in much Marxist writing seeking to elide the differences between proletarians of different nationalities on the basis that there is a long-term tendency towards equalisation of wages.</p>
<p>Smith makes the point that equalistion of wages within a national economy is predicated on free movement of labour, freedom to sell labour-power to the highest bidder. This does not occur in the present moment as labour is massively restricted by immigration controls and racism.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Rate of Exploitation is Independent of Workers&rsquo; Productivity</strong></p>
<p><em>240</em> In Vol. 3 Marx outlines a number of things factors which work against the tendency of the rate of profit to fall.</p>
<p>One of these is the pushing of wages below the level of labour power, another is capital invested in colonial trade, a third is firms in more advanced countries selling commodities over their value, which is effectively a manufacturer making use of a new technology or discovery before its use has become generalised. This is a super-profit, as more technically advanced capital can produce a commodity is less time than the average necessary labour time required by less technically advanced capital.</p>
<p>These super profits only arise in competition between capitalists in the same branch of production, producing similar goods such as cars, chemicals or clothing.</p>
<p><em>242</em> It is crucial to emphasise that a more productive worker using more technologically sophisticated machinery does not produce more exchange value but rather allows their employer to capture a larger share of it. The rate of exploitation is not higher in more productive capitals than in less productive capitals.</p>
<p><em>243</em> Therefore, value transfers to innovating capitals from less advanced capitals within the same branch of production due to differences in the productivities of the individual capitals within that branch. This results in divergence in the rate of profit enjoyed by individual capitals.</p>
<p>Value transfers between different branches of production are effected by different value compositions of the total capital employed in the different branches.</p>
<p>In a unitary economy in which capital and commodities move freely this results in convergence of the rate of profit betweeen the different branches and the formation of an average, economy-wide rate of profit.</p>
<p>Whether trade between countries involves competition between firms trading similar goods or the exchange of dissimilar goods is very important as it determines the regime of value transfer which is in place.</p>
<p>As detailed above, trade between imperialist nations is in similar goods, but the trade of goods from the global north and the global south are different.</p>
<p>N - N trade differences in productivity are a prime cause of value-transfers and a prime determinant of above or below average profits.</p>
<p>N - S trade is not.</p>
<p><em>244</em> Therefore we need an alternate reason for the reversal of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, which we can derive from an account of super-exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>Super-Exploitation in Marx&rsquo;s Capital</strong></p>
<p>Two quotes from Marx on super-exploitation:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;As far as capital invested in colonies, etc., is concerned, the reason why this can yield higher rates of profit is that the profit rate is generally higher there on account of the lower degree of development, and so too is the exploitation of labour, through the use of slaves and coolies, etc.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;There is no reason why the higher rates of profit that capital invested in certain branches yields in this way, and brings to its country of origin, should not enter into the equalisation of the general rate of profit and hence raise this in due proportion, unless monopolies stand in the way&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Quantified Labour in Marx&rsquo;s Theory of Value</strong></p>
<p><em>245</em> Recapitulating important points:</p>
<p>The quantity of value objectified in commodities by one hour of living hour is entirely independent of the productivity of a worker. A more productive worker is allowing their employer to capture more exchange value.</p>
<p>Assuming all workers in this branch work with the same intensity, all of their labour is counted equally toward the total value generated in that branch. If they are all paid the same wage they are all equally exploited, regardless  of productivity differences existing between those working for more or less developed capitals.</p>
<p>The higher rate of exploitation in the global south which follows from the above represents the paying of wages below the value of labour power.</p>
<p>Marxists who continue to reject dependency theory therefore reject Marx&rsquo;s law of value.</p>
<p><em>246 - 7</em> A series of quotes from Marx relating to the role of value creation viz. skilled v. unskilled labour.</p>
<p>Smith argues Marx considers this relationship in transient terms, within a single national economy, progressively eroded by competition between workers and by deskilling of skilled labour as complex and labour-intensive forms of production become mechanised and simplified.</p>
<p>Attempts to explain the huge divergences in wages which exist between the north and south via skilled v unskilled labour are therefore useless.</p>
<p><strong>Falling Rate of Profit</strong></p>
<p><em>248 - 9</em> Smith&rsquo;s point of view on the falling rate of profit is twofold:</p>
<p>First that many of its adherents fail to register the national variations in the rate of exploitation and the organic composition of capital due to monopoly rents and consequently that a substantial part of the surplus value captured by firms in imperialist countries and realised as profit was extracted from workers in low-wage countries.</p>
<p>and second that whether or not the rate of profit goes up or down the decisive question is whether the total mass of surplus profit is sufficient to provide returns to those with claims on it. When it is not, as occurred in 2008, it will be the far more decisive factor in triggering crises.</p>
<p><strong>The Placing of Outsourcing in the History of Capitalism</strong></p>
<p>A line in <em>Grundrisse</em> which Smith relates to outsourcing:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;As long as capital is weak, it still relies on the crutches of past modes of production, or of those which will pass with its rise. As soon as it feels strong, it throws away the crutches, and moves in accordance with its own laws. As soon as it begins to sense itself and become conscious of itself as a barrier to development, it seeks refuge in forms which, by restricting free competition, seem to make the rule of capital more perfect, but are at the same time the heralds of its dissolution and of the dissolution of the mode of production resting on it&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 9: The GDP Illusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is GDP? - 1</strong></p>
<p><em>253</em> The UN definition of GDP:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciations of fabricated assets or for depletion and degredation of natural resources&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>GDP is therefore the sum of the value added recorded by all firms in a national economy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gross&rsquo; value means no account is made for depreciation of capital goods.</p>
<p>GDP can be calculated in three ways:</p>
<p>i) input-output tables to calculate value-added
ii) total expenditure in an economy - expenditure on intermediate inputs
iii) total income of firms, households and government</p>
<p><em>254</em> The problem is that GDP only measures monetary value of commodities produced for final sale and does not include output that is not traded, such as domestic labour, for the reason that it does not produce commodities but use-values, which are beyond the grasp of orthodox economics.</p>
<p>GDP ignores this concept and renders GDP arbitrary: GDP does not measure market production, market production defines GDP.</p>
<p><strong>GDP and GNP</strong></p>
<p><em>256</em> GDP differs from GNP (Gross National Product) because the former includes income generated domestically by foreign firms / individuals and excludes income generated overseas by a country&rsquo;s own firms and citiziens.</p>
<p>The shift from GNP to GDP entails output produced in factories or mines based in a particular nation state comes into that nation&rsquo;s financial records, even if the money doesn&rsquo;t stay there.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 10: All Roads Lead into the Crisis</strong></p>
<p><em>280</em> This book has emphasised the role of productive capital, rather than finance capital, in capitalist crises.</p>
<p>The 2007 - 8 financial crises were side effects of two principal measures the west put in place to escape the crises of the seventies, the enormous expansion of debt and the shit of production to low-wage countries.</p>
<p>The first propped up demand, alleviating overproduction (the production of more goods than can be sold for a profit) and the second restoring sagging profits by substituting relatively expensive domestic labour with cheap labour in low-wage countries.</p>
<p><em>290</em> 2008 is a story of low interest rates encouraging people to take on more debt. Rather than having claims on future value, there turned out to be nothing behind them, particularly when corporate entities are not investing their profits in further growth, but spending them on dividends and stock buybacks, inflating the value.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine described a short story in Adrian Duncan’s 2021 collection Midfield Dynamo as ‘like John McGahern with the humanity stripped out of it’. If you read McGahern’s works in chronological order you can see this humanity begin to edge out the harshness and repetition elsewhere, or at least begin to assert itself more often as a necessary opposite. The last line of McGahern’s last novel is essentially a pitch for a comprehensive transcendence or transformation, a conclusion which I once heard a relative describe as ‘too easy’.</p>
<p>The essential difference between McGahern and Duncan lies in the distinct nature of the labour depicted in their works. While McGahern’s is the world of the small farmer, what he referred to as the little Republics woven into self-sustaining rural communities, Duncan’s characters, particularly those engineers central to The Geometer Lobachevsky, are the vanguard of this world’s dissolution. An intuition in dialogue with geometry and mathematics is the more ambivalent route Duncan takes, as opposed to the seasons or natural world through which McGahern gains access to something beyond. Duncan does allow for a dignity, self-realisation or orientation becoming possible through work, but just as often it leads to failure, confusion or death.</p>
<p>The plot centres around a Russian geometer, Nikolai Lobachevsky, who travels to the Irish midlands in the fifties to assist a man named Rhatigan in surveying a bog. Lobachevsky attempts to explain how the uneven and mobile surface of the landscape complicates its mapping but the elaborate way in which he tries to do so fails and renders him an object of mockery in the area. Any social ties which arise in Lobachevsky’s movements from the midlands and out west seem uncertain and may well be artefacts of Lobachevsky turning over his daily routines in his mind, slipping out of his alienation in self-forgetfulness.</p>
<p>In a conversation with the architect Emmet Scanlon, Duncan described his research into Free State’s initial attempts at becoming a developmental state and this seems to represent a significant source of inspiration for The Geometer Lobachevsky. Electrification, Ardnacrusha and industrialised extraction of peat all significantly complicate that notion propagated by the postwar intelligentsia of the Free State, that Ireland was an ignorant, navel-gazing rural backwater. The acclaim Duncan’s works have secured to date has in large part to do with how unique themes such as state-formation and infrastructure are, not just in contemporary Irish literature but I think literature in general. Though I haven’t read nearly as much Russian literature as I would like to, I am totally unaware of any other work in which the ambivalence of being a technocrat in a specific post-revolutionary context is treated with this level of seriousness.</p>
<p>Means of securing buy-in from the existing administrators of Tsarism was a consistent problem for the Bolsheviks once the Russian proletariat had overthrown Kerensky’s Provisional Government, while in the Free State the situation was very different, there being a significant amount of continuity between Ireland under the British and the Free State. Cumann na nGaedhal, a pro-Treaty party whose social base was derived from large farmers and southern unionists, made no attempt to construct a state which might compete with British capitalism, but rather sought to faciliate it, committing itself to extreme fiscal rectitude to suppress domestic demand and subsidising large farmers who exported their agricultural products to Britain, effectively condeming the landless and labouring elements who had been most active in seeking to secure Irish independence during the Tan war to degredation, unemployment and emigration.</p>
<p>The continuity of British institutionality was maintained despite the large number of Irishmen already working in administrative roles; the main criticism voiced by senior civil servants was that their inherited system deviated too far from the British model. C.J. Gregg, a personal friend of William Cosgrave, was leased in from London’s Board of Inland Revenue to lead the committee which formulated the final recommendations for the Free State’s reorganised government. Gregg not only favoured retaining the title ‘The Treasury’ for the Department of Finance, but also attempted to secure a role for the Department over and above that of the elected cabinet. Just as the state enforced this regime from above it is important to remember that Local Appointments Boards dominated by the church hierarchy also played its role in stifling the emergence of a indigenous technocracy. In this way Irish professionals were oriented within a reformed Empire; the new establishment in which Rhatigan envisions himself has no need for qualifications or professionals, just intermediaries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there are a number of premonitions of the coming order in which the state’s investments will become more international in character; old triangulations through which Ireland was mapped relative to Britain are being severed and the new ones will serve to lift Ireland three metres out of the sea. Rhatigan’s observation that ‘Accuracy’s children have devoured their parents’, channels Stephen Dedalus’ sow that eats her own farrow, an axiom that might be said to underpin the vast majority of historiography written on the post-revolutionary orders in both the USSR as well as the Irish Free State. I find Rhatigan’s phrasing of the issue more convincing; not just because it repudiates these clichés as well as Joyce’s Viconian perspective, but because it captures the pressures bearing down upon Ireland and their distance from historic Republic aspiration.</p>
<p>We also see the section of the state which remain as yet unsubsumed when Lobachevsky spends a period of time working with Irish speaking labourers harvesting seaweed. Lobachevsky is not invited to assist in the more involved aspects of their labour, or is only allowed to do so under close scrutiny, as though they fear, correctly, the steady erosion of their way of life. Lobachevsky actually witnesses a synecdoche of this process take place in overhearing a conversation as two people ‘speak for some moments in Irish with shreds of English weaved through…and the shreds of English grow into sentences that overcome the collapsing strings then atoms of Irish they were speaking’.</p>
<p>One significant difference between the way in which the Free State and the USSR is framed comes in the form of the representation of the Bolsheviks, who appear as thugs or boors, while the local enforcers of the Free State regime are absent. We have a representation of the Romanovs’ executions (whose barbarism went far, far beyond anything undertaken by the Soviets) and this at least emphasises the violence inherent in the changing of the guard; civil war legacies of summary executions, military tribunals and atrocities are mediated exclusively within a ‘brother against brother’ paradigm. Looking at the two political formations which arose out of the civil war we see that these divisions tended to fall far more along family and class lines rather than through them; the scenario represented in The Wind that Shakes the Barley is more the exception than the rule.</p>
<p>Threading the themes I’ve touched upon here will involve spoiling the ending of the novel, so I’ll conclude by saying that Duncan’s refusal to make things ‘too easy’, to turn away from the furrow he works towards the rising sun, is what makes his work so unique and essential. Read this book, and all his others.</p>

<p>Thomas Clarke was born in 1858 to an Irish family living in Hampshire in England. His father was in the British army and was briefly stationed in South Africa before the family returned to Dungannon in County Tyrone, where Clarke became involved in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret society founded by the Fenians in 1858 to advance the cause of Irish separatism. Imprisoned for fifteen years for his role in an incendiary bombing campaign in London, Clarke emigrated to the United States, where he re-founded the IRB with Patrick McCartan and Denis McCullough. When Clarke returned to Ireland, he did so with the aim of cultivating a new generation of Irish revolutionaries, turning them away from collaboration with the Irish Parliamentary Party under John Redmond, whose influence was at its peak. In 1912 the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith struck a bargain with Redmond, that Irish Home Rule would be granted if the IPP voted for his finance bill; effectively promising Ireland devolved powers within the British Empire. This set in motion a chain of events which would allow Clarke’s far more marginal organisation to eclipse Redmond’s in the struggle for Irish independence.</p>
<p>Once Home Rule was on the horizon, Irishmen loyal to the British crown, primarily but not exclusively in northern parts of the country, began to organise against its introduction. Leaders of the campaign — the barrister Edward Carson and politician James Craig — spoke at meetings of the Orange Order, a Protestant supremacist organisation whose founding dates back to the 1798 revolution and attacks which were conducted organisations allied with the United Irishmen. Carson and Craig encouraged the Protestant population to boycott their Catholic neighbours and stirred them up into rioting. On 28 September 1912 Carson led thousands of unionists to sign the Solemn League and Covenant, which pledged that all signatories would resist the introduction of Home Rule by any and all means. In 1913 these loyalist militias, armed and trained by British amy officers, were brought within the umbrella of the Ulster Volunteer Force. In response to loyalist activism Asquith declared any county within Ireland in which a majority of electors opposed Home Rule would be allowed to opt out and thus the foundations for the stifling of Irish democracy via partition were laid.</p>
<p>The IRB began to recruit a volunteer army to challenge this loyalist threat. Six months after it began accepting recruits, it had acquired almost 200,000 members and had succeeded in procuring 900 rifles. Redmond, concerned that his control over the national movement would be undermined by the Volunteers, demanded twenty-three of his appointees be placed on the governing committee. Though the Volunteers accepted Redmond’s ultimatum in order to prevent a split in the movement their magnanimity was not to be rewarded. Once the Home Rule bill was passed — accompanied by a suspensory act that required it to be ratified by Westminster an additional time — Redmond split the Volunteers himself by declaring that in order to prove their capacity for self-rule, the Irish should enlist in the British army and fight for Empire. More than 90% of the Volunteers did enlist but a more militant cadre repudiated Redmond and seized the Volunteer offices in collaboration with James Connolly’s Citizen Army, an organisation founded to protect striking workers from crown forces and armed scabs during the 1913 Lockout. In the general atmosphere of imperial sentiment that marked the outbreak of the war these Volunteers were regarded with bemusement and sometimes hostility. In his memoir Victory and Woe: The West Limerick Brigade in the War of Independence, Mossie Harnett writes that just a few weeks before the Easter Rising, soldiers’ wives threw rotten eggs at marching volunteers. In his memoir of the War of Independence, On Another Man’s Wound, Ernie O’Malley records his own scepticism, seeing them as insufficiently brave to fight overseas and therefore unlikely to fight at home.</p>
<p>As the mass slaughter on the western front began to dampen Irish enthusiasm for the war effort and the British began to consider moving against the Volunteers in order to more smoothly implement conscription, Clarke, together with other members of the IRB Military Council such as Éamon Ceannt, Seán MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Padraig Pearse and Joseph Plunkett informed Connolly of their plans for an insurrection on Easter Sunday of 1916. The leader of the Volunteers, professor and Irish cultural nationalist Eoin MacNeill, would not have agreed to pre-empt conscription’s introduction and would only support engaging the British defensively. In order to force his hand, the IRB forged a document appearing to be an internal memorandum from Dublin Castle calling for the arrests of the Volunteer leadership. Once MacNeill learned that this document had been forged and that a shipment of German arms intended for the Volunteers had been intercepted by the British navy, he issued a countermanding order. This order went far wider than anyone on the IRB expected, MacNeill even succeeded in publishing it in the newspapers. The IRB decided to proceed with the Rising, but to postpone it until the following day. The IRB attempted to inform volunteers outside Dublin that the Rising had only been postponed, but this was in large part unsuccessful, many volunteers had already destroyed their arms or uniforms.</p>
<p>The main garrison occupied by the Volunteers was the General Post Office on O’Connell Street, Dublin’s main thoroughfare and the forces there were under the command of Connolly, Clarke, Pearse and Plunkett. The 1st battalion occupied the Four Courts, the 2nd Battalion Jacob’s Biscuit Factory, Eamon DeValera led the third battalion in Boland’s Mills and the fourth occupied the South Dublin Union. Connolly’s Citizen Army, who the countermanding order did not affect, were divided between Stephen’s Green, City Hall and the GPO. Telegraph wires were cut, bridges and railway lines blown up to delay the arrival of British reinforcements forces but by Tuesday crown forces had begun to come in from the Curragh and Dun Laoghaire.</p>
<p>The original plan for the Rising was to form a circle around the Four Courts and to send out lines to connect with forces coming from other parts of country, but the reduction in Volunteer numbers had decided the Rising would be an unsuccessful confrontation with the British from the outset. By Thursday much of O’Connell Street was on fire due to the British gunship Helga on the River Liffey and the roof of the GPO was on the brink of collapse. All the women were evacuated, with the exception of Elizabeth O’Farrell, Winifred Carney and Connolly’s nurse, who all refused to leave. At a meeting of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic at its new garrison on Moore Street, Clarke favoured fighting on, but in order to prevent further loss of life among the Volunteers, a surrender document was issued, signed by Pearse and Connolly to ensure the other garrisons would step down.</p>
<p>The newspapers variously reported the Rising as being communist, suffragette or German in nature. The executions of Clarke, Pearse and MacDonagh were cheered on by the bourgeois presses and William Martin Murphy, a business magnate whose anti-union practices had been challenged by Connolly’s Irish Transport and General Worker’s Union three years before, called for the execution of Connolly in particular. On 3 May Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke were executed by firing squad followed by Plunkett the following day. On 8 May Ceannt and Connolly were shot and on 12 May MacDiarmada followed. The British initially planned to execute ninety Volunteers, but stopped as broader opinion began to swing in favour of the revolutionaries, with Redmondites branded as murderers for cheering on the terror.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin Comes to Power</p>
<p>Though the Sinn Féin organisation founded by journalist and monarchist Arthur Griffith had nothing to do with the Rising, it was to be the primary political beneficiary as, not for the first or last time, the incompetent response of the British to Irish liberation struggles succeeded in installing otherwise marginal political actors in a pantheon of Irish patriots alongside Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet. Three thousand Volunteers, teachers, writers, journalists and Gaelic Leaguers regarded as sympathetic to the cause of Irish separatism were imprisoned. Prison sentences were handed down to civilians carrying Sinn Féin flags or whistling rebel songs, further eroding the space that existed for the IPP’s pursuit of dominion status within the Empire. Count Plunkett, father of the executed leader of 1916, won a by-election in Roscommon in February 1917. While Plunkett seemed likely to secure a leading role in Sinn Féin, he was eclipsed by De Valera, who stood on a 1916 platform in another by-election in Clare. Joe McGuinness, a Gaelic Leaguer who was deported and imprisoned in Britain for his role in the Four Courts, was put forward as a candidate in a Longford by-election, beating the IPP candidate Patrick McKenna. In the 1918 election Sinn Féin won 73 of 101 seats, but instead of taking them in Westminster, they formed a new clandestine parliament in Dublin, aiming to appeal to the Paris Peace Conference for recognition of the Irish Republic over and above the heads of the British. As internees received amnesties large crowds gathered to meet them as they arrived in Dublin, underlining the extent of the support which now existed for Sinn Féin. When the IRB member Thomas Ashe, murdered in prison while on hunger strike for political status, tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral.</p>
<p>The British response to the Rising was of course not the sole reason for this transformation of the political landscape. The work of Irish Republican women in Cumann na mBan did much to create the situation in which 80 new branches across the nation seeking affiliation with Sinn Féin were established. Crucial too was a longer process of cultural development through organisations such as the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association, through which folk memories of cultural difference and an anti-imperialist tradition were preserved and renewed. Harnett refers to an awareness he had growing up of an ancestor Muiris Ó’h-Airtnéide who was in involved in Fenian resistance to the Famine. Dan Breen recalls his neighbours’ ‘exultation over the victories gained by the Boer Generals…how thrilled they were by the British defeat at Spion Top’. Education provided by Irish-speaking teachers or older relatives are often cited by military leaders within the IRA as formative, though there were others who came from more apolitical backgrounds. Tom Barry describes joining the British Army not because Redmond had told him to, but because he wanted to see what war was like. O’Malley’s background was middle-class and seonín. The political development of these men took place in the years after the Rising, amidst mass campaigns and general strikes against conscription. O’Malley describes reading in Republican newspapers about what the men of 1916 had fought for and Connolly’s Labour in Irish History while Barry records his repudiation of his education dominated by British monarchs, reading about Eoghan Ruadh, Patrick Sarsfield and John Mitchel.</p>
<p>The number of Volunteers rose to over 100,000 in response to the renewal of internment on the pretext that the Volunteers were fifth columnists loyal to the Germans. The British also banned the GAA and arrested Sinn Féin’s most prominent leaders. In De Valera’s absence the influence of a Corkman named Michael Collins on the Supreme Council of the IRB grew. The presence of a secret society at a high level within the Republican movement was an ongoing point of contention for a number of senior figures within the IRA, including Breen and 1916 veteran Cathal Brugha. Sinn Féin organised itself to outflank the British, misdirecting authorities through decoy meetings and building institutional power in the form of a functioning administration through courts, tax collectors, a postal service and a civic police force in areas from which the British had been ejected. Sentences from these courts varied from fines, to a demand that both sides agree to shake hands, to parading the guilty outside chapel gates on Sunday with their offences written on pieces of cardboard tied around their necks. All this was sustained through subscriptions, sporadic donations secured from the population, obtained with varying degrees of willingness or consent, as documented in Patrick O’Sullivan Greene’s Crowdfunding the Irish Revolution. Representatives of the Irish Republic also presented themselves abroad; once his escape from prison had been arranged De Valera toured the United States in order to raise money and draw on the support of Irish Americans. Cumann na mBan members such Nora Connolly, Margaret Skinnider and suffragette Hannah Sheehy Skeffington were central to these endeavours, using speaking tours as a rallying point for anti-imperialist activism in the United States. These diplomatic missions were rarely successful; even with the help of the labour movement the American administration valued its relationship with Britain far more than the nascent Irish Republic.</p>
<p>Breen was one of the Volunteers in the 3rd Tipperary Brigade who, impatient with the moderate and constitutional approach of Sinn Féin, engaged the British militarily at Soloheadbeg towards the end of January. Two British soldiers were killed in the course of the ambush, which was planned in order to intercept a consignment of gelignite. Sinn Féin initially offered no support; Minister for Defence Richard Mulcahy referred to the men as murderers. Breen admits that there was no majority in favour of fighting the British at this stage, but once crown forces began to mete out draconian punishments upon the broader population in response to IRA ambushes, this began to change. When Constable Michael Enright and Sergeant Peter Wallace were shot during the rescue of Seán Hogan from the custody of Royal Irish Constabulary, a Kilmallock jury in Limerick refused to return a guilty verdict demanding instead self-determination for the Irish people. This dynamic, whereby the Sinn Féin leadership would find themselves out of step with a broader and more Republican mass sentiment, was to become a fixture of the Irish Revolutionary period. There was often suspicion among the small farmers and workers who in large part waged the armed campaigns of the party bureaucrats in Dublin whose primary interest was in maintaining Sinn Féin as a constitutional force. The determination of local leaders to not have to take orders from central government was another, more concrete reason for this contradiction.</p>
<p>The British proscribed the Republic’s institutions and began recruiting ex-servicemen into auxiliary units in 1920, once the extent to which the RIC had lost their legitimacy had become clear. These auxiliaries, or Black and Tans, aimed to choke off the IRA’s access to accommodation, food, intelligence and assistance from the civilian population by driving into towns, firing randomly, ordering civilians out of doors, stripping men and beating them with rifle butts, commandeering food, torturing IRA members, destroying farm equipment, confiscating vehicles or just shooting and lynching civilians for fun. The wanton sadism of the auxiliaries only served to boost Sinn Féin’s legitimacy further among a population, who became increasingly willing to feed and shelter revolutionaries and uphold boycotts of the police or businessmen sympathetic to British rule.</p>
<p>The IRA, making no effort to emulate the structure of a conventional army, adopted an elastic structure, dividing into companies and then sections, which varied in seize from fifty to one hundred, depending on population, terrain, personnel and available resources. Officers were elected by ballot and military engagements were embarked upon only when it was more or less certain that more casualties would be inflicted than sustained. As is usually the case in irregular warfare the civil and political aspects of the conflict took on a greater importance. Barry’s account of the countryside in West Cork emphasises the class composition of the area, particularly with regard to the Big Houses of the Protestant Ascendancy, a cohort of large merchants and landlords. These were not only concrete historic documents of the acquisition of land and labour by imperial conquest, their social position secured by the Penal Laws and the Act of Union, but also one of the primary means through which the British gathered intelligence in the area. Beneath the Ascendancy there were the smaller merchants, among whom were some Catholics afforded a share in the dividends of Empire, as well as retired British naval and army officers. Billeting and procuring food and accommodation at loyalist homes allowed the IRA to monitor potential British assets and alleviate the pressure on more sympathetic elements of the population where food, shelter or warmth were more likely to be scarce. Barry established a habit of having the men manoeuvre in demesne land to rid them of a taught deference to the landed gentry, underlining some of the more pragmatic aspects of decolonisation understood as an internal or psychological process. Barry records instructing those who were identified as spies and informers to leave the country within 24 hours, their land divided into the hands of the landless labourers or taken into the Republican administration, although there were also many instances in which they were summarily executed. The benefits of these sentences, cutting off the Brits from their intelligence networks as well as setting an example to others unsympathetic to the Irish Republic, had to be balanced against maintaining sympathy among the broader population; mercy could and sometimes was shown to British soldiers who were known to have not executed or mistreated any prisoners. Fortified posts as well as buildings commandeered by the Black and Tans were obvious targets for the IRA though unlike most volunteers, the Black and Tans had experience of warfare and ample resources in the form of artillery, machine guns or armoured vehicles. The extent of the achievement of a largely unarmed unprofessional army, its leaders deriving what expertise they had via military textbooks or journals, training in secret, carrying out successful operations on fortified posts using the few arms they had acquired, sometimes without ammunition or unreliable grenades improvised from tins with scrap metal and gelignite, under the acute stress brought about by hunger, long marches across rough terrain and weather is almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin in Power</p>
<p>Sinn Féin had been an umbrella movement which, under very specific circumstances, had brought together monarchists, nationalists and Republican separatists within a single unified front for national liberation. Once serious discussions about the precise nature of the Irish state being struggled for began to be posed, as in the Treaty negotiations which followed May 1921 truce, these different factions within the organisation entered into open conflict. Cumann na mBan member Mary MacSwiney detected a more conciliatory tone among the leadership around this time, noting that Collins did not make any reference to the Republic while delivering a speech in Armagh. Those Republicans who were later to take up arms against the Free State recall the appearance of newspaper articles outlining the benefits of dominion status, the nature of the Commonwealth membership enjoyed by Canadians and the impossibility of renewing the armed struggle. Republicans such as O’Malley and Dinny Kelly who fought in Tipperary, record similar sentiments being broadcast among those who had joined the army after the ceasefire; these factions were referred to as ‘truceleers’.</p>
<p>Liam Mellows, veteran of the abortive 1916 Rising in Galway, expected negotiations with the British to break down and continued his work in procuring arms from overseas. This wavering of confidence in the capacity of the constitutional movement to deliver the Republic was present also among the leadership, with Brugha refusing to form part of the Irish delegation. Collins, Griffith, Secretary of State Robert Barton, E.J. Duggan, T.D. for the constituency of Louth-Meath and Gavan Duffy, T.D. for Dublin County, ultimately formed the delegation. President De Valera’s reserve status allowed him to periodically intervene to make demands upon the plenipotentiaries, to their frustration. There were further divisions within the negotiating team itself; confidential discussions took place between Collins, Griffith and the British cabinet and on certain issues they made common cause with the British against the others, as when Griffiths corresponded with Lloyd George about the role the British monarch might have in Irish affairs. Much has been written on whether or not De Valera, having some sense in advance that the British would not grant a Republic, sent Collins and Griffith so that blame for the inevitable compromise would fall on them, but no direct evidence of such arithmetic exists. I personally find De Valera’s naive faith in his legislative hypothetical of ‘external association’ a more convincing explanation for his actions than Machiavellianism.</p>
<p>The objectives of the British cabinet were obvious; allowing the Irish to leave the Empire would strengthen the hand of independence movements in India and Egypt. The British had also been pro-active in securing their position in the north up to this point; the 1920 Government of Ireland Act created the statelet of ‘Northern Ireland’ from the counties of Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone. The loyalists’ demand for six counties, as opposed to the nine counties of Ulster, was based on their calculating that they would not be able to maintain control of the Catholic majorities beyond those of Fermanagh and Tyrone. Over the summer of 1920 loyalist leaders had encouraged pogroms against Catholics which began in Belfast and continued sporadically over a number of weeks. By the end of the summer 16 Catholics had been killed and nearly 200 houses and shops burned. A boycott of goods from unionist firms in Belfast was passed in the Dáil.</p>
<p>The Articles of Agreement placed significant limitations on Irish self-determination. They allowed Britain to retain control of Irish ports, required all parliamentarians in the Dáil to swear an oath of allegiance to the British monarch and did not bring about any change in the imposed border. Personal allegiances, loyalty to regional commanders as well as opinions expressed by constituents, were as important as political principle in deciding what side one came down on as opposed to another. Many accounts report the saying ‘What is good enough for Mick Collins, is good enough for me’ entering into general circulation. De Valera and Brugha were the most prominent anti-Treaty figures within Sinn Féin, though they were in no way leading this tendency; Republicans who took against the Treaty were hugely divided. Mellows rejected both the Treaty and De Valera’s proposed compromise of external association on the basis that the Republic and the 1919 election was an authentic mandate now held hostage by British propaganda and threats of an invasion: ‘The people are being stampeded, in the people’s minds there is only one alternative to this Treaty and that is terrible, immediate war. That is not the will of the people, that is the fear of the people’. Mellows, together with O’Connor and O’Malley, advocated renewing the struggle against the British, while others, such as Breen and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch, vacillated between this position and the prioritising of army unity. That Frank Aiken, an officer who had fought in Louth and Armagh, initially declared neutral will provide some indication of how differentiated the strategic orientations among the Republicans.</p>
<p>Cumann na mBan was the first Republican organisation to oppose the treaty and one of its members, Constance Markiewicz, spoke during the Treaty debates in terms of the precedent this treaty would establish for national liberation struggles elsewhere, ‘if we pledge ourselves to this thing, whether you call it Empire or Commonwealth, that is treading down the people of Egypt and India’. P.S. O’Hegarty identifies this as the point at which more middle-class elements, such as merchants, cattle dealers and manufacturers, began to take the upper hand within the movement in the name of social stability. They were uninterested in the Republic which had been fought for, but recognised Sinn Féin as as ascendent social force. On the character of this new establishment O’Malley wrote: ‘Socially they had little status. Instead of building their own background, they often tried to ape the mannerisms of the relicts of the garrison, and to develop the ambition to belong to a class which had another social fabric to their own’. Their interests were perfectly compatible with those of the southern unionists, who Griffith met in the course of the debates. Markiewicz asked Griffith on the basis of what democratic mandate he had done so given that southern unionists belonged to a class who had enjoyed the dividends of British imperialism.</p>
<p>In the months before the summer election Collins met with Craig, now head of the regime in the six counties and pledged to end the Belfast boycott in return for assurances that Catholic workers who had been chased from their jobs would be re-instated. Meanwhile Lloyd George established the Ulster Special Constabulary, or B-Specials, a paramilitary colonial police force modelled on Mussolini’s fascisti. Under the dictatorial powers Craig secured in the special powers act the B-Specials were indemnified against prosecution while Sinn Féin, the IRA and Cumann na mBan became proscribed organisations. By mid-1922 there was one armed policeman for every two Catholic families and during the first months of 1922, 171 Catholics were killed.</p>
<p>Though the role of the British in copper-fastening partition and inflicting terror on the Catholics in the six counties has been relatively well-documented, the extent of the involvement of the British in the establishment of the Free State is often understated. Winston Churchill demanded an election be held on the Treaty as soon as possible, but with anti-Treaty sentiment in the army standing at around 63% by Florence O’Donoghue’s estimate, Mulcahy adjourned a decisive convention, at first for one day and then for three months, on the basis that Collins would draft a Free State constitution in the interim period, which was to be Republican in character. The IRB also postponed further discussion on this basis. On 16 March Griffith proclaimed the scheduled army convention. Officers who opposed the treaty such as Oscar Traynor, Sean Russell, Mellows, O’Malley, O’Connor and Lynch formed their own military council, establishing a new headquarters in Parnell Square, aiming to wrest control of the army from the Free State. In an interview given to a newspaper, O’Connor explained that in passing the treaty, the Dáil had effectively abolished itself as it had no mandate to abandon the Republic. The army, which had remained loyal to the Republic declared in 1916, had de facto, become the Republic’s legitimate government. In April they established a garrison in the Four Courts and occupied a number of buildings around Dublin but they remained divided between those who wanted to initiate an attack on the British immediately and those who were more interested in preserving army unity. This latter faction entered into negotiations with Mulcahy and though they had no authority from the Executive to do so, and were denounced by O’Connor and Mellows, no discipline was imposed. Florence O’Donoghue recalls the aimlessness of the debates: ‘It never had a common mind or a common policy. There was not time. Many matters, not strictly the concern of the army, obtruded in discussions, social theories were aired and debated, projects were considered in an atmosphere of unreality, stresses developed which weakened the fabric of authority’. These divisions on strategic orientation and wrangling over the scheduling of conventions worked to the advantage of the Free State which had time to plan for a decisive confrontation once it arose.</p>
<p>Those in favour of the Treaty were far more focused in their aims and in anticipation of an inevitable confrontation began to transfer arms from areas dominated by anti-Treaty army units. While Griffith was more forthright in denouncing Republicans, accusing Erskine Childers of being a British agent, Collins and Mulcahy spoke and acted in more conciliatory terms, allowing representatives of the Republican military council to attend Free State army meetings. Collins also gave the appearance of being more Republican in inclination, organising the assassination of Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial Staff who had personally arranged to keep troops in Dublin, had been involved in the Belfast pogroms as well as well as in organising the B-Specials. Collins also formed an electoral pact with De Valera, which sought to replicate the composition of the second Dáil by offering the electorate a panel of Sinn Féin candidates in identical proportion to the existing Treatyite and anti-Treatyite balance of forces, effectively postponing an electoral decision on the matter. Collins and Griffith were summoned to London a number of times and informed by Churchill and Lloyd George that the pact with the Republicans violated the Treaty, that the withdrawal of British troops would be suspended while it remained in place and began to pressure the Free State government to take decisive action against the Four Courts garrison. That Collins repudiated this pact three days before the election and his promised Republican constitution, published on the day of the election, was subordinate to the Treaty and illegitimate insofar as it contravened it, suggests that he regarded all these overtures to Republican elements within the army as stalling tactics. The pro-Treaty faction of Sinn Féin won 58 seats and the anti-Treaty faction under De Valera took 36. Twelve days after the election the Free State army began to shell the Four Courts with arms obtained from the British. Giving further indication of how detached the Republican’s understanding of the situation was from reality, Mellows cautioned against using too much ammunition against the Free State army as they would need them for the British. Once the Four Courts garrison and the Republican Executive had been dismantled, the Free State had a freer hand to recruit among ex-British soldiers and draw on the support of more overtly anti-Republican elements in Irish society as well as the large pool of unemployed, offering twenty-five shillings per week.</p>
<p>In his memoirs of being imprisoned in Mountjoy during the civil war, the republican socialist Peadar O’Donnell writes about encouraging Mellows’ socialist analysis of the situation, believing that he would distinguish himself as a leader in the future. Though the bulk of the army was ignorant of socialism, and arguably hostile to politics as a point of principle, notes Mellows wrote to O’Malley and Stack from prison identify the men of no property as central to their campaign against the Free State. In The Workers’ Republic, the newspaper of the Communist Party of Ireland, Mellows wrote on the necessity of leading the Labour movement away from commercial and British imperial interests:</p>
<p>‘The Irish Labour Party talked glibly of a Worker’s Republic. It still pretends to have as its objective the establishment of such a state…The existing Irish Republic can be made the Workers’ and Peasants Republic if the labour movement is true to the ideals of James Connolly and true to itself’.</p>
<p>If the Free State was to have been overthrown before it was consolidated as the reactionary and imperial formation it remains today, this would have been the way to do it, but sadly the opportunity for an alliance between anti-imperialists and the working class was quashed due to inadequate leadership and the Free State’s brutality. More typical of the Republican strategy of the time was O’Connor’s reaction to the postal workers’ strike, which was not to support workers’ demands, but rather use the confusion to capture arms of civic guards being brought in as strike breakers. Anti-Treaty volunteers did not make common cause with working class elements establishing Soviets at creameries, but rather threatened to to fire on members of the Transport Union picketing shops in Clonmel that refused to sell butter manufactured by them. Though the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and the Democratic Programme ratified by the first Dáil threaded together anti-imperialism and democratic ownership of the nation’s resources, as the Revolution unfolded it became clear that these were not principled aims of the leadership. O’Malley later regretted not undertaking guerrilla warfare and organising flying columns against the Free State. Establishing a garrison in the Four Courts had been a mistake, given that it was easy to surround, lacked food, had faulty defences and their other forces were concentrated on the wrong side of the widest street in the city.</p>
<p>Harnett attributed the defeat of the Republican side in the civil war to insufficient commitment on behalf of the Republican side; his account of this period is full of instances in which the lives of captured Free State officers were spared and released with money and clothes. The brutality of the Free State’s reprisals, the military courts and Emergency Powers Resolution, granted the state the power to execute prisoners. On a more local level, a definitive turning point was the moving of Free State army men from their local areas where they may be engaging former comrades to to other areas, in order to free up their consciences. The church hierarchy withheld sacraments from Republicans and consistently denounced Republicans from the pulpits even as eighty-one Republicans were executed in 28 rounds between November and May 1923. Mellows, O’Connor, Joe McKelvey and Richard Barrett were also executed and the demoralisation of having such treatment meted out by former comrades, fellow Irishmen and senior IRA officers is a feature of these first-hand accounts.</p>
<p>The legacy of the Free State will not require extensive treatment here. Its administration had much in common with the supposedly overthrown English model. There were some initial attempts at developing indigenous industries, but in overall terms Free State governments have been composed of individuals from comfortable backgrounds who have favoured low taxes, the subsidising of financiers, rentiers and large farmers, suppressing wages and instituting savage cuts to social welfare. The fact that women, such an active constituency during the Revolution in transporting arms, making splints, bandages, clothes and food, nursing, carrying dispatches, scouting, spying, raising funds, arranging billets or undertaking long journeys delivering dispatches at great personal risk vanish from public life for almost half a century, grants a new significance to them being among the most vociferously opposed to the Treaty. The welfare state was farmed out to the church and the Irish language entered into a terminal decline in which it still languishes. The inertia and lack of any significant Republican voice in the present moment corresponds with Mellows’ premonition of a ruling class which would be propped up on the basis of partition:</p>
<p>if this Free State comes into existence, when you will have a permanent government in the country, and permanent governments in any country have a dislike to being turned out, and they will seek to fight their own corner before anything else. Men will get into positions, men will hold power and men who get into positions and hold power will desire to remain undisturbed and will not want to be removed, or will not take a step that will mean removal in the case of failure.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the sixty-odd years the New Left Review has been in existence, the country in which the overwhelming majority of its editorial staff and stable of regular contributors were born, grew up and lived has maintained an occupation of six counties on the island of Ireland against the wishes of the Irish people. Irish resistance to partition, which reached an historic high point over a thirty-year period in the lifetime of the journal, became and has remained a rallying point for independence and national liberation movements from South Africa to Palestine. These struggles are not merely historical however. Since 1998, many Republicans have written on the Belfast Agreement as the latest stage in British imperial strategy, the copper-fastening of colonialism via the creation of a new garrison class among the nationalist population.</p>
<p>The NLR has to date, published 369 issues. Three of the twelve articles it has published on Irish politics were written by three luminaries of the British &amp; Irish Communist Organisation, a London-based cadre of Moscow-style socialists who argued that unionists in the six counties constituted a nation separate from the Irish people and possessed their own right to national self-determination. They also published an interview with the commanding officer of the Official IRA Cathal Goulding, who shared BICO’s analysis. Beyond the titans of two-nations thought, the NLR published Conor Cruise O’Brien on the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, Evelyn Mahon on the position of Irish women in the Catholic Free State, Brendan O’Leary on the Belfast Agreement (an extremely legalistic and apolitical account), three discursive analyses of Irish nationalism by Terry Eagleton and Ronan Bennett on New Labour’s vacillations and opportunism with regard to the six counties. Daniel Finn, now an editor at NLR, wrote twice on the political re-alignments in the twenty-six county state in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, firstly in general and secondly with regard to the water charges campaign. Finn also wrote an account of the life and critique of the work of Fintan O’Toole, a review of a book written on Easter 1916 by historian Diarmaid Ferriter and another on the history of the Provisional IRA by Tommy McKearney. Agnès Maillot reviewed Finn’s overview of the IRA in 2020.</p>
<p>With regard to book reviews Alasdair McIntyre wrote up Desmond Greaves’ biography of James Connolly, John Saville’s reviewed Ronald Read and Eric Glasgow’s book about the Irish Chartist Feargus O’Connor and Declan Kiberd reviewed a collection of Francis Mulhern’s essays in the year 2000. In full then, twelve articles, seven book reviews and one interview, with Finn responsible for 30% of it.</p>
<p>Typing the word ‘Ireland’ into the searchbar on the NLR website of course returns significantly more results, but the majority of these mention Ireland as an aside, reeled off as part of a list of other straightforwardly western or European nations / tax havens. In any conclusive discussion of how NLR has framed Ireland, these references must form part of the picture as one does not have to pick very many examples at random to find significant howlers. In his 2015 review of Douglas Newton’s Verso book The Darkest Days: The Truth Behind Britain’s Rush to War, 1914, NLR editor Alexander Zevin writes that shortly before the outbreak of World War I, ‘most of the British political class from the King downwards had nearly given up hope of heading off a civil war in Ireland over the introduction of Home Rule, and were either straining instead to see what shape it might take, or retreating to their seats in the countryside’. We would seek to inform Zevin, who may of course be parroting Newton, that while the British ruling class may not have seen Gavrilo Princip as having a significant influence on world politics, they were not bystanders when it came to the brewing civil war over Home Rule. They were after all continuing to occupy the place, had stated their intention to liquidate all-Ireland democracy by allowing particular counties to ‘opt out’ of Home Rule were it to be introduced and were also training and arming loyalist militias.</p>
<p>There is furthermore the broader oeuvre of the NLR’s stable of contributors to consider. The writings of Tariq Ali, Robin Blackburn and E.P. Thompson all form a totality I do not have the time or resources to map though isolated moments do come to mind. Though Perry Anderson has never written a full-length work on Ireland, there is little that is objectionable in the few cursory pages he writes on the democratic deficits explicit in the twice-presented Nice referendum in The New Old World, a 2009 study of the centre-periphery dynamics of the European Union. Anderson’s famous hypotheses, developed in collaboration with Tom Nairn have very little to say about British imperialism. Nairn later wrote about the necessity for ‘Ulster’ to develop its own national identity, described the Union’s forecasted break-up in terms I’ve always found weirdly abstract and, as David Edgerton has points out, with an unjustified emphasis on British ‘decline’. Zevin, in his history of The Economist magazine’s editorials, does not stint on the extent of the slaughter the British brought about in Ireland during An Gorta Mór, though we might wish that he used less words suggesting that this was a tragedy or a case of poor administration on the part of the British. Dylan Riley’s 2010 history of fascism contains three uses of the word ‘imperialism’, all of them cursory, all of them in his chapter on Italy, thereby missing the rather obvious case study offered by the Orange State. The introduction to a subsequent edition apologises for this omission, but makes no significant redress.</p>
<p>This article is in many respects a follow-up to Sam Porter and Denis O’Hearn’s ‘New Left Podsnappery: The British Left and Ireland’ which appeared in the NLR in 1995. While Porter and O’Hearn address themselves primarily to two articles published in the NLR the previous year, Ellen Hazelkorn &amp; Henry Patterson’s ‘The New Politics of the Irish Republic’ and Eric Hobsbawm’s ‘Barbarism: A User’s Guide’, they also make reference to a number of other publications in the NLR archive on Ireland; Peter Gibbon’s ‘The Dialectic of Religion and Class in Ireland’ (1969) and ‘Ireland — Split in Sinn Féin’ (1970).</p>
<p>Before moving onto Porter and O’Hearn’s critique I will consider some of the relevant pieces Porter and O’Hearn do not offer touch upon. Cruise O’Brien’s ‘The Embers of Easter 1916 – 66′ (1966) amounts to an alternative history of the 1916 Rising, wherein the leaders kept the powder dry until a rallying point for a mass campaign to overthrow British imperialism emerged, as when the British introduced conscription. Doing so might have allowed for mutinies of Irish soldiers on the Western front and the staging of a socialist revolution in Ireland. Cruise O’Brien does not do so in order to represent the Rising as a failure, but more in order to identify the tragic distance between the bilingual Workers’ Republic envisioned by Pearse and Connolly and the twenty-six county state in 1966, when partition is meekly accepted by the population. Cruise O’Brien is of course writing this article about three years before the war began as well as his pivot from anti-imperialism to unionism, but credit where credit is due, it is Cruise O’Brien who has the distinction of defining Connollyite politics as an alliance with the Vietnamese peasantry in the pages of the NLR.</p>
<p>MacIntyre’s short review of Greaves’ biography of Connolly from the magazine’s eighth issue, features a full-throated endorsement of Connolly’s politics and strategic orientation, from his involvement in syndicalist politics to the Rising and identifies Noël Browne and Jack McQuillan’s recently formed National Progressive Democrats as taking up Connolly’s mantle. The first paragraph of Saville’s review of Ronald Read and Eric Glasgow’s book on Francis O’Connor dismisses the book’s emphasis on O’Connor’s Irish background, but without knowledge of the book, we’ll have to give it the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Porter and O’Hearn are generous in their treatment of Gibbon’s articles because of how well it holds up relative to Hazelkorn and Patterson, written as it was at a time when denying the repressive nature of the Orange state would have been too much even for a British audience. Reading Gibbon now we see much of the ideological groundwork of the BICO position on partition being laid, described as a natural outgrowth of Ireland’s failure to conform to the proper stages of industrial development or class formation; references are made to  authentically bourgeois ‘Ulster’ Protestants, politically backwards ‘southern’ peasants and the notion that the ‘Ulster’ working class was more British than Irish.</p>
<p>Porter and O’Hearn take aim at Hazelkorn and Patterson’s attempts at legitimating British Rule by arguing that the Free State and the irredentist peasantry’s dispossession of British landlords was cruel, that Irish Republicanism does not express authentic class politics but rather criminality and that the support it historically obtained among the working class, both rural and urban, is due to nationality or shared confessional affiliations. Hazelkorn and Patterson eulogise what the BICO-ist analysis of the Workers’ Party once contributed to Irish politics – by this time split into the Workers’ Party / Democratic Left – without touching upon the violence, criminality or intellectual bankruptcy on the Official IRA’s side of the Sinn Féin split. The stageist analysis put forward by figures such as Eoghan Harris is maintained here too, as well as the necessity of ‘modernising’ the economy of the twenty-six state along neoliberal lines.</p>
<p>Porter and O’Hearn argue that BICO’s central failure in their political and economic diagnosis was located in their treatment of the economy of the twenty-six counties as separate from broader developments in global capitalism and the underdevelopment inherent to imperialism. Within a few paragraphs Porter and O’Hearn provide a far richer account than any BICO member has ever managed by outlining the dependence of the twenty-six counties’ ruling class on Foreign Direct Investment, its incorporation within the EU and acceptance of deflationary orthodoxy as well as the synthetic wartime economy in the six-county state in which the unionist working class had a significant economic stake as it was an important source of employment.</p>
<p>Hobsbawm’s article is an attempt to prove that human society has become more, rather than less, barbarous since the onset of capitalist modernity. One of Hobsbawm’s key examples is that in the early modern period and even into the nineteenth century, prisoners of war would not be executed and military violence would be restricted to combatants. The rise in barbarism is in large part attributed to tactics of armed struggle adopted by national liberation movemenets, such as the Fenians as well as the IRA, to whose provocations, Hobsbawm argues: ‘even the British in Northern Ireland did not keep their cool in the early years’ [My emphasis]. Hobsbawm goes so far as to argue that the Irish were in many ways fortunate to have lived under British occupation: ‘If the British state had abdicated in Ulster [sic] as the Yugoslav state did, we would have had a lot more than some three thousand dead in a quarter of a century’ and that the campaign of internment and torture was far milder than in other jurisdictions as it did not include, for example, the application of genital electrodes, which, of course, it did.</p>
<p>Porter and O’Hearn gut Hobsbawm’s argument with only a handful of examples from the history of Irish Republican struggle, noting that a brutal campaign of violence and repression against non-combatants was waged by England after the 1798 uprising. Officers and civilians alike were attacked, decapitated, set on fire in their homes and hospitals; the ravaged corpses of children were publicly displayed in town centres. Even Lord Cornwallis, the British viceroy in Ireland, described how the British army ‘butchered without discrimination’. The involvement of the highest levels of British intelligence with Loyalist paramilitaries, its responsibility for the worst atrocities of the war against civilians, as in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, all go unmentioned by Hobsbawm.</p>
<p>The content of NLR editor Robin Blackburn’s response to Porter and O’Hearn, in the sniffy ’Ireland and the NLR’ (1995) frequently strays beyond belief. Blackburn argues that the armed campaign of the IRA undermined any mass movement that would have developed in Britain for withdrawal, putting forward that familiar canard that if only the tactics adequate to national liberation were rejected, support from the metropole could be freely given.</p>
<p>Blackburn concedes that the NLR has not published enough on Irish politics, but maintains that what it has published is not lacking in substance. Blackburn argues that in an article published in 1972 he predicted the consequences that the British state’s involvement in the six counties would have for the Heath government. In this article he writes: ‘a violent clash is now underway between two forces neither of which can offer any long-run solutions’. Blackburn also argues that the IRA may bring about the destruction of the Stormont regime but rebukes them for failing to appeal to Protestants and reproduces the BICO-ist line that proper Marxism rejects national liberation struggle, neither orange nor green but Nairn’s ‘red Marxism’.</p>
<p>Blackburn argues that the NLR is a journal of debate that holds no position on Northern Ireland [sic] and cites Ken Livingstone, Eric Heffer and Tony Benn as figures who have called for the re-unification of Ireland and de-militarisation in the 80s and 90s in the pages of the NLR. Everything Benn, Heffer and Livingstone call for is more or less correct, but their cases for ending partition are never framed in terms of the rights of peoples to self-determination. Rather, they consistently seek to advance the electoral success of the Labour Party or the hand of the British working class. Reducing spending on the occupation will allow for increased investment in social welfare and arrest the growth of reactionary attitudes among soldiers in the British Army so they can be won to class struggle; this attitude also plagues Bennett’s piece, mentioned above. It is Benn who is most succinct in expressing his chauvinism: ’The victims of all this activity [the war of counter-insurgency in the six counties], in addition to Harold Wilson, were many other Labour ministers, MPs and individuals, and even Edward Heath, who may well have lost his leadership of the Conservative Party’.</p>
<p>Blackburn rallies to the defence of Porter and O’Hearn’s primary targets, arguing Patterson and Hazelkorn were commissioned on the subject of ‘the Irish Republic [sic] [emphasis Blackburn’s]’, validates their argument that Irish Republicans should ally themselves with the EU, in order to convert Loyalists from their British to a new European identity and further maintains the baffling hypothesis, a constant refrain from the NLR since its founding, that Britain has no strategic interest in its colonies, British capitalism is retrograde, on the brink of collapse, etc. Blackburn also maintains Hobsbawm is correct, but does not challenge any of Porter or O’Hearn’s points.</p>
<p>Blackburn saves the best for his footnotes, arguing that he has spoken in favour of a federal arrangement for ‘the Islands of the North Atlantic’ and furthermore published Slavoj Žižek’s analysis of the representation of the IRA in Neil Jordan’s film The Crying Game (1992).</p>
<p>By way of conclusion I want to focus on Kiberd’s 2000 review of Mulhern’s essay collection, which, though I have not read it, seems very much of its time, in the sense that much of the scholarship written within the field of Irish studies in the late nineties and early oughts did not manage to attain a sufficiently critical distance from the society from which it arose. Anyone who studied Irish literature in college will know what I mean here; undue optimism over for example post-nationalism, Mary Robinson, the Belfast Agreement and so forth. Kiberd lays into Mulhern’s lack of interest in contemporary imperialism, his claims that all nationalisms are alike and scores a great blow in going after the willingness of the international Marxism that Mulhern represents ‘to proof the new consumerist order against attack from those revolutionary national traditions which it was quietly liquidating. 1991 [the year Mulhern launched his attack], as it happened, was also the year in which the Dublin government failed to invite the five surviving veternans of the Easter Rising to its furtive, apologetic and by then utterly perfunctory commemoration’.</p>
<p>There is much that is symptomatic in Mulhern’s throwing his lot in with the Free State intelligentsia without knowing what he was talking about and this points to the problems of a publication over-emphasising the virutes of debate for its own sake, or having two people who identify as ‘Anglo-Irish’ as fixtures of an editorial board. This is probably around the point in the essay that I argue that the NLR could and should do better but ultimately, no publication that has mentioned Field Day once in its entire history cannot hope to claim to have ever done justice to the Irish conjuncture at any stage. This is also, incidentally, a major oversight in Finn’s critique of O’Toole, which otherwise deserves its place in some of the best critical writing to have come out of Ireland in recent times; it is a tragedy that I cannot think of a single Irish-based publication that would be likely to carry it.</p>
<p>Indeed, I can think of perhaps two analyses of the Irish left which have appeared in a British or American-based publication over the past decade that did anything other than provide a cosmetic history of Sinn Féin and its supposed socialist credentials. We can speculate on a few reasons why SF holds out a certain amount of appeal to a British left audience. Corbyn’s involvement with and support for re-unification is one, Gerry Adams’ memeability another but on a more serious note SF can slot quite well into a narrative of continuity Corbynism, i.e. the parliamentary road to socialism. That the intended audience for this bilge have not taken sufficient interest in the facts of SF’s record as compliant administrators of British imperialism should not surprise us.</p>
<p>In order to know what is happening on the Irish left it is pretty well mandatory to be involved in an organisation or have a DM group with a few centrally-located heads who like to gossip. It is for this reason that we need more politically engaged Irish publications. Rupture, both the podcast and magazine, represent a progressive step in this direction. Its being published by the RISE network in Ireland’s largest socialist party, People Before Profit, ensures its orientation towards political and strategic questions, rather than the requirements of branding or clout alone. It may even in time develop into a vehicle sufficient for the debate over tatics and strategy that the Irish left is desperately in need of in order to achieve the 32 county socialist republic.</p>
<p>Note: The NLR’s use of the phrase ‘Northern Ireland’ and even worse, ‘Ulster’ to refer to the six counties is endemic. I have made the attempt to denote each faulty instance with ‘[sic]’ which may be annoying to read.</p>
<p>However insisting in specificity in the use of these terms is more than mere legitimism. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 imposed a border on the island of Ireland, separating six counties in the island’s north-eastern corner — Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone — from the other twenty-six counties. This was undertaken in order to secure British imperialism on the island as well as to bolster the unionist dispensation within this synthetic construction. As this border violates the terms of the Irish Republic, declared as an all-Ireland state in 1916, the titles one uses in order to refer to either of these entities ascribe legitimacy, either to the Republic locating itself in a broader history of anti-imperialist struggle, or the border imposed on the island which overturned the will of the Irish people, as expressed in the election of 1918.</p>
<p>A Fine Gael-Labour coalition government declared the twenty-six county state to be the Republic of Ireland in 1949, but for many Republicans this ratifies the idea that two separate states exist on the island and that the Republic possesses no territorial claims on the six counties. For those who accept the legitimacy of partition, the six-county state in the north is referred to as ‘Northern Ireland’, while Republicans opt for ‘the six counties’, ‘the northern statelet’ or ‘the occupied territories’. While those who accept the legitimacy of the twenty-six county state would refer to it as ‘The Republic of Ireland’ or ‘the Republic’, Republicans would refer to it as ‘the twenty-six counties’, ‘the south’ or ‘The Free State’. I myself use either ‘the twenty-six counties’ or ‘the six counties’.</p>
<p>The six-county statelet is not in any sense ‘the North of Ireland’ as it does not contain a number of Ireland’s most northerly counties. The twenty-six county statelet is not ‘Southern Ireland’ or ‘The South’; the twenty-six counties are 85% of the area of the island. It is Ireland’s North, East, South and West. The six counties were and remain a synthetic invention, carved out of the Irish nation in order to construct a herrenvolk proto-fascist democracy; euphemisms depending on invented geography can only erase this fact.</p>

<p>People first came to Ireland ~9,000 years ago. ~4,000 BC domesticated livestock, stone axes which were used to clear forests to provide farmlands, grindstones to mill grains and clay pots to cook in were introduced. By ~2,500 BC copper was being mined in Cork and Tyrone, tin in the Mourne mountains and gold in Antrim (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 28).</p>
<p>Celtic society was surprisingly coherent; one can see from the Brehon Laws - a body of surviving law tracts surviving from the 7th - 9th centuries - that there is a clear unity of culture and language across the island, a clear conception of Ireland as a nation before such concepts would have been regnant in Europe.</p>
<p>The language used in these laws is uniform and grammatically standardised; it was written by members of the <em>Áes Dána</em>, who were professional jurists whose authority transcended local boundaries.</p>
<p><em>Lebor Gabála Érenn</em> recounts a national origin myth in which successive waves of invaders from the time of Cessair to Noah&rsquo;s son Bith to Partholón, who fought the Formorian demons, to Nemed the Scythian to the <em>Fir Bolg</em> (who may be related to the Continental Celtic tribe Belgae) to the <em>Tuatha Dé Danann</em>, the climax coming with the Milesians, descended from the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, Scota, which gives the island its Latin name.</p>
<p>Scota&rsquo;s son Goídeal Glas gives his name to the people and their language; which seem to have been derived from the Welsh, Gwyddyl; this fixation on genealogy, probably derived from the Bible, grants a powerful sense of dynastic solidarity. (Duffy 4 - 12)</p>
<p>The Celts controlled major trade and ritual centres and practiced more efficient lowland agriculture, milling grain with rotary querns and outperforming upland cereal farmers (Duffy 4; O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 29).</p>
<p>The basic unit of political organisation was the <em>túath</em>. While many within the <em>túath</em> were related, there would often have been many who were not related to the <em>túath</em> by blood. In that sense it was not strictly tribal, despite the system of naming <em>túath</em> and other territories after an ancestor.</p>
<p>Brian Bóraime&rsquo;s dynasty was called Dál Cais because it claimed to be the <em>dál</em> of a supposed ancestor called Cass. But this was the name of both the lineage and the territorial kingdom from which the lineage ruled, not everyone in that territory belonged to the lineage (Duffy 7).</p>
<p>The Irish population was organised into 100 - 150 of these <em>túath</em>, led by a <em>rí</em>. Mid-level kingdoms exacted tributes from each tuath and in turn were partly controlled by an <em>ard rí</em> drawn from political groupings calling themselves the <em>Uí</em> of or the <em>cenél</em> of or the <em>corcu</em> or the <em>dál</em> of x (Duffy 8).</p>
<p>Early medieval Ireland was therefore extremely hierarchical; they were were divided into royal kin, aristocrats, free farmers and slaves, a hierarchy of professional craftsmen, lawyers, clerics and poets formed a fifth group, which was itself sub-divided.</p>
<p>Slavery was very common; a person could be born into it, taken as a spoil of war, or condemned to it as punishment for a crime.</p>
<p>The commoner or non-lordly class comprised those who owned or aspired to own land. There were eight different ranks of commoner, the disparity between grades can be seen by the differing &lsquo;honour prices&rsquo; or compensation payable for a legal offence against them.</p>
<p>Thus a man of cultivated land had an honour price of three milch cows, a cow-freeman would be owed two and a half, that of a between-house man - a son yet to acquire his own land - was a two year-old heifer (Duffy 5 - 7; O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 29).</p>
<p>Individuals did not therefore own land in their own right but as part of a kin-group, which was not the modern family, but a four-generation <em>derbfhine</em>, comprising male descendants of a common great-grandfather, though women could inherit movable goods and a life interest in the family if their father had no sons.</p>
<p>The <em>derbfhine</em> held land jointly, which was marked off from that of the neighbouring kin-group by fences and boundary stones, each member having an equal share of the family land. With the passage of each generation the land was re-partitioned between surviving members so each had an equal portion of good and bad land, arable, pasture or bog etc.</p>
<p>Over time inheritance came to be confined to a closer male-descent group, the <em>gelfhine</em>, comprising a man, his sons and his son&rsquo;s sons; there is only limited evidence that land was held by large numbers of people in common (Duffy 4).</p>
<p>Privately owned land was a source of income for the <em>rí</em>; the relationship between the <em>rí</em> and a client was based on granting cattle in return for a rent of produce, surplus livestock, physical labour or military service; this is the basis of feudalism as a mode of production.</p>
<p>Unusually for Europe at the time, clients could terminate their contract with a <em>rí</em> to seek a better one elsewhere and in this way, free commoners could become relatively wealthy, take on their own clients and be elevated to royal kin after a few generations (Duffy 6; O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 29).</p>
<p>The Hill of Tara preserves monuments from the late Stone Age. There are extensive remains from the Bronze and Iron age but little archaeological evidence for its occupation or use during the middle ages.</p>
<p>It features prominently in Irish mythology as being connected with the the gods of ancient Ireland; when the sons of <em>Míl</em>, the ancestors of the Irish, first arrived in Ireland they confronted the <em>Túatha Dé Danann</em> at Tara and defeated them at nearly <em>Tailtiu</em>, this underlined their claim on Tara and Ireland in general.</p>
<p>On the Hill of Tara there is a stone called the <em>Lia Fáil</em> which cries out beneath the feet of the rightful king of Ireland; the individual concerned did not necessarily ever manage to control each kingdom but he special status was recognised (Duffy 13).</p>
<p>The kingship of Tara was monopolised by the <em>Uí Néill</em>, one great dynasty with many sprawling branches, and Tara came to be associated with their attempts to claim hegemony across the island.</p>
<p>Muirchú, who wrote a life of St. Patrick around the year 700, describes the celebrated historical or pseudo-historical figure Niall Noígiallach (&ldquo;Niall of the Nine Hostages&rdquo;) as one who descended from the royal stock of the entire island, which is an exaggeration but indicative of how many dominant lineages traced themselves back to Niall.</p>
<p>Assuming he was real he may have lived in the fifth century and descended from Conn Céthathach (&ldquo;Conn of the Hundred Battles&rdquo;) who is believed to have lived seven generations before Niall, in the late Iron Age (Duffy 15).</p>
<p>This dynasty was divided in the southern Uí Néill of the midlands and the Northern Uí Néill, both of which are terms of convenience for competing branches (Duffy 16).</p>
<p>Irish churchmen were active on the continent from the seventh century, beginning with Columbanus. They were missionaries but also teachers, grammarians, classicists and philosophers.</p>
<p>The most important social change introduced by Christian, Viking and Norman settlers was the development of towns; the Celts&rsquo; settlements were decentralised and indigenous forms of centralisation came in the form of the rí&rsquo;s homestead, which usually consisted of a ring fort and church or monastery  (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 30 - 1).</p>
<p>Gibson argues that an early state form emerges from this context around the twelfth century when Muirchertach Uí Briain of Thomond moved his capital outside of his kinship area from Clare to Limerick. This reflects the development of a diocesan system of territorial administration indicating that political units were for the first time not co-terminous with the <em>tuatha</em> (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 30 - 1).</p>
<p>Dícúil writes about hermits in the Faroe Islands being harassed by Vikings; indicative of experiences of churchmen in north-west Europe faced with raiding (Duffy 44).</p>
<p>The first recorded raid took place in 793 when a monastery founded by Irish monks on Holy Island at Lindisfarne in Northumbria was attacked.</p>
<p>Raids on Ireland began in 795 as either Rathlin or Lambay Island was burned by the Vikings, its shrines were broken and plundered (Duffy 46).</p>
<p>Writings also describe their settling areas they raided, setting up sheep pastures. Patterns of warfare suggest territorial engagements against an established force, all indicating that more sophisticated social and economic relations than mere raiding had developed (Duffy 45 - 6).</p>
<p>In the 830s Ireland was exposed to intensive Scandinavian assault, beginning at Leinster and Southern Uí Néill territory in Brega, with fleets operating in the Boyne, the Liffey, the Shannon, the Erne and Lough Neagh. In 841 the Vikings built a ship-camp in Dublin and another at Linn Duachaill followed by one on Lough Ree.</p>
<p>The late 840s saw a string of Irish victories; the King of Osraige Cerball mac Dúnlainge made a name for himself as an opponent of Viking activity in the Barrow Valley, killing 1,200 Vikings. The following year Máel Sechnaill killed 700 in a battle at Skreen, the combined forces of Munster and Leinster killed 200 or 1,200 near Castledermot.</p>
<p>The Frankish Annals of St-Bertin record the following year a delegation arrived at the court of Charlemagne&rsquo;s grandson Charles the Bald bearing gifts from presumably Máel Sechnaill, announcing the vanquishing of the heathens by the Irish (Duffy 52).</p>
<p>Unclear whether Irish military tactics adapted to the Vikings using ships, their being located permanently in parts of Ireland led to them take sides in Irish wars and becoming vulnerable to Irish resistance; this disunity provoked some to join the Irish side or if Iceland presented a more appealing prospect for unsettled land (Duffy 53).</p>
<p>Many Scandinavian rulers acquired wealth from trade in slaves and luxury commodities such as walrus-ivory; Norse settlement in the form of coastal ports therefore increased the volume of Irish trade and communication with Europe.  (Duffy 45 - 6).</p>
<p>Successive waves of English conquest transformed the Irish economy and society as an Anglo-French aristocracy established military supremacy across most of the island, confining Gaelic power to the west and mountainous, boggy parts of the south and the east, seeking to convert parts of Leinster and Munster into a seignoral social order and manorial culture based on intensive arable agriculture as opposed to pastoral husbandry to grow corn for English and continental holdings; the Normans nominally controlled two-thirds of Irish land in the fourteenth century, with their wooden castles scattered throughout the countryside along with mills (especially in Leinster) which were ruled by agents who acted as military officers, local justices.</p>
<p>Clan members were striped of legal right to lands and chieftans were made landowners. Lands were confiscated and resettled. This created a class hierarchy between native Irish, settler or absentee Irish, Anglo-Irish and Scotch-Irish.</p>
<p>Market towns the Viking had established along the coasts were consolidated under the English monarch. Towns were a base of operations for a substantial English artisan, merchant community and were also sites of trade for both Irish and foreign goods such as wine from France; political instability had little effect on new commercial relations (Coakley 6 - 9; O&rsquo;Hearn 30 - 1).</p>
<p>The 1366 Statutes of Kilkenny mandated that any English person who did not speak English were given six months to learn it or they would forfeit their Church appointments; these laws were also directed against Irish customs, dress, sport, names, indicative of an English anxiety regarding the Anglo-French aristocracy (hereafter referred to as the Old English) becoming Gaelicised (Coakley 11 - 2).</p>
<p>The Black Death reached Ireland in 1348; it hit more developed Anglicised areas much harder, strengthening the position of the peasantry against the lords and further undermined the position of the Normans in the cities who depended on trade. This encouraged them to establish trade relationships with the indigenous population, despite this being illegal; Gaelic forms of pastoral farming re-asserted themselves against agrarianism (Coakley 14 - 5).</p>
<p>Over time Normans began to enter into marriage alliances with Gaelic chiefs. Some Gaelicised lords abandoned all loyalty to the crown, some did not. A syncretic form of law drawing from English, Brehon and French traditions began to develop.</p>
<p>This is at once an example of political, economic and legal formations following economic ones and within this there are more pragmatic aims; serves the purpose of reducing cattle raids and the instability which would have followed were adherence to English laws of primogeniture not abandoned. By the fifteenth century English documents begin to refer to the &lsquo;degenerate English&rsquo; in Ireland. (Coakley 19 - 20)</p>
<p>The lowland region around Dublin, &rsquo;the Pale&rsquo;, was the only place in Ireland that an English-style gentry emerged, but it too diverged from the English model; though it was the only place arable farming was happening in Ireland there was no prosperous yeomanry existing between the landowners and the broader peasantry (Coakley 21).</p>
<p>From the thirteenth century on Gaelic chiefs began building castles, first of wood then stone. They also recruited Norse-Gaelic mercenaries from the Scottish islands, indicating their growing capacity to mobilise resources outside of their kin groups (Coakley 26 - 7).</p>
<p>The expansion of militaries in the early modern era facilitated the emergence of state bureaucracies, rendered nation states more coherent. State centralisation and religious reform were part of the same process in Ireland; this was an attempt to subordinate autonomous Gaelic communities beneath English law (Coakley 35 - 6)</p>
<p>One of the means of doing so was &lsquo;surrender and re-grant&rsquo; whereby the chiefs would surrender their land and have it granted under the authority of the British monarch (Coakley 37).</p>
<p>This programme was implemented largely through coercion; the Earl of Kildare, who owned the richest agricultural land in Ireland, was executed and garrison were built across the country; the social order was further undermined by the Brits backing some Gaelic chiefs in internecine conflict against others. (Coakley 41)</p>
<p>Coakley argues the Reformation caught on in Europe because it provided an internal and impersonal answer to the collapse of feudal customs. [We also know it served as a superstructural response to / legitimation of the dissolution of bonds of kinship, productive limits and moral law in usury, land ownership]</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take outside of urban areas in Ireland because these bonds of kinship were still strong, there was a persisting paganism in Catholic practices [this is often over-stated] and because it became identified with military conquest. (Coakley 44 - 7)</p>
<p>Coakley attributes the distinct developmental patterns of Ireland, Wales and Scotland to the less aristocratic character of its Norman settlers and a strong Gaelic literary tradition. (Coakley 51 - 74)</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century the Brits adopted more coercive policies in Ireland with a view to Anglicising and subjugating the country. This was aim of Elizabeth I&rsquo;s conquest which began with a 1556 project to confiscate all lands in Laois and Offaly, granting them to English settlers (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 39).</p>
<p>At this time the majority of the population lived in small clustered rural settlements situated around the manorial residence of the feudal lord. Many peasants drove their livestock to the highlands during the summer for pasture, where they built temporary accommodation for themselves and their families; this often led to foreign observers mistaking the Irish for a nomadic people.</p>
<p>The fertile lands of Leinster and Munster supported a number of well-established towns, the largest being Dublin with around 20,000 with the next four, coastal ports of Waterford, Limerick, Cork and Galway with less than 5,000.</p>
<p>The native Irish lived almost exclusively in rural communities dominated by leading clans or families such as the O&rsquo;Neills, the MacCarthys and the O&rsquo;Briens.</p>
<p>Programmes of dispossession and plantation followed the English victory over the native Irish of Ulster in the Nine Years War (1594 - 1603) and the defeat of Hugh O&rsquo;Neill, earl of Tyrone, who went into exile with thousands of unemployed swordsmen who fought in French and Spanish armies.</p>
<p>The Old English dominated the big urban centres - with the exception of the Pale - and newly created plantation boroughs in Ulster. They formed part of a broader European trading network, exporting wool and cattle hides and importing textiles and wine from Flanders, France and Spain; each town guarded its local autonomy from outside interference and prevented the native Irish from living within the defensive walls of the settlement.</p>
<p>James VI regarded the Old English with suspicion, referring to them as &lsquo;half-subjects&rsquo;; the King retained his predecessor&rsquo;s policy of excluding them from public office, appointing more reliable and more rapacious English Protestant officials who intrigued for control over the big landed estates.</p>
<p>This New English population consisted of soldiers and administrators, from 1610 a government-sponsored plantation scheme redistributed lands seized from Hugh O&rsquo;Neill and his northern allies among thousands of Protestant migrants from England, alongside ever greater numbers of Scotland.</p>
<p>By the 1630s the Protestant population of Ulster stood at 80,000, many of whom identified themselves as British. There were tensions between the new English and the Scots but fear of the indigenous kept them united.</p>
<p>A series of boroughs were created to stimulate urban development but apart from Derry, Enniskillen and Carrickfergus the vast majority of the settlers lived in small fortified settlements, anxious about threats to security from bands of native outlaws in the woods, mountains and bogs of the province.</p>
<p>There were other concentrations of Protestants along the southern coastline, in Cork, Kinsale, Bandon and Youghal and the Munster Plantation, by 1640 they numbered over 20,000 and came mainly from the southern and western counties of England.</p>
<p>The Old English hoped to retain their influence and mitigate the worst excesses of religion discrimination through the Irish parliament. This hope seemed to be validated in 1628 when Charles I, at war with France and Spain, granted a series of concessions to Irish Catholics known as the &lsquo;graces&rsquo;, which included a statute of limitations on royal claims to land, protecting Old English estates from possible future confiscation and plantation. In 1629 peace overseas reduced political pressure on the king, allowing him to rescind the graces.</p>
<p>Thomas Wentworth was appointed Lord Deputy in 1632, who, supported by the king, made extensive use of arbitrary powers to further erode the Old English position.</p>
<p>In 1637, Scottish presbyterians, outraged by the King&rsquo;s attempts to impose Anglican religious rites signed a national covenant in protest. Their actions escalated into a full-scale revolt, with covenanters seizing control of Edinburgh and recruiting a large army, including veterans who had fought for King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.</p>
<p>Charles looked to Wentworth to provide money and troops and the Lord Deputy recruited Catholics in the rank and file of a new army of 10,000 men.</p>
<p>Charles signed a treaty with a Scots before Wentworth could employ his force and the Lord Deputy, promoted to the earl of Strafford, left Ireland shoftly afterwards to assist the King at Court.</p>
<p>In his abscence the Old English leaders successfully colluded with Stafford&rsquo;s Protestant opponents in the English and Irish parliaments to get him executed.
They did not manage to convince the king of the need to make concessions to Irish Catholics and considered taking up arms, drawing on troops Wentworth had raised, while native Irish landowners in Ulster, in debt and worried about the anti-Catholic rhetoric of the covenanters, contacted influential Irish exiles such as Owen Roe O&rsquo;Neill to discuss the possibility of a rebellion supported by intervention from the continent.</p>
<p>This programme of dispossession and enforced reform, including recusancy fines, imposed for failing to attend Protestant services, prompted the 1641 rebellion, which began as an elite revolt and then spread across the country. It overlapped with the English Revolution during which a new agrarian and colonial merchant elite was asserting itself against the monarchy and seeking support for the Protestant cause in Europe (Ó Siocrú 9 - 14; Coakley 79).</p>
<p>Sir Phelim O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s father Turlough Oge had fought for the English during the Nine Years War and was killed while trying to suppress a subsequent rebellion in 1608. In recognition of his father&rsquo;s services Pehlim received estates in the Ulster Plantation. He was raised as a ward of the court in the Protestant faith, attended Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in London then returned to Ireland in the 1620s where he reverted to Catholicism; he was knighted in 1639 but was still subject to religious persecution as well as being heavily in debt. (Ó Siocrú 22)</p>
<p>As the senior resident O&rsquo;Neill Phelim attracted the attention of similarly disgruntled Catholic landowners searching for his support for a pre-emptive strike against the colonial administration, based on the success the Scottish covenanters had obtained, negotiating with the king from a position of strength.</p>
<p>The Ulster Irish envisioned an assault on two fronts. Sir Pehlim targeted Charlemont and other key points in South Ulster to prevent Protestant settlers in the area from linking up with forces from the capital. At the same time Lord Conor Maguire&rsquo;s men would storm Dublin castle, paralyse the government and obtain access to a vast quantity of weaponry.</p>
<p>Sir Phelim&rsquo;s plan was successful, rallying thousands of followers to his banner, especially among landed labourers and small tenant farmers, but in Dublin a companion of Lord Maguire, Owen O&rsquo;Connolly, managed to slip away from his colleagues and alert the authorities. The conspirators were rounded up, incuding Maguire, who was executed in London (Ó Siocrú 23).</p>
<p>This still motivated unrest in north Leinster and a few weeks after O&rsquo;Neill had seized Charlemont violence broke out in Munster.</p>
<p>The original conspirators belonged to the landed elite, they claimed to be acting in self-defence against the colonial administration but remained loyal to the king and aimed at communicating their grievances to him.</p>
<p>Local Catholic landowners assumed command in their areas but found it difficult to control the rank and file, who increasingly attacked Protestant settlers, particularly in Ulster. This was evident at first with a series of thefts but  soon reached more extreme atrocities, as at a massacre in Portadown in November, where estimates suggest ~5,000 Protestants died. A roughly equal number of Catholics were killed in government reprisals, who exploited the ituation to attack vilians (Ó Siocrú 24 - 5).</p>
<p>These atrocities fanned hysteria; a series of unlicensed publications in England reported 150,000 Protestant deaths, far exceeding the total settler population (Ó Siocrú 28 - 9)</p>
<p>As refugees from the rebellion came into Dublin witness depositions were collection, the bulk between 1642 - 3, but a Commission for Despoiled Protestants continued its work until September 1647, with Henry Jones, Dean and later Bishop of Clogher, recognising the propaganda value of the testimonies, exploiting the harrowing accounts of death and destruction to build a case for the re-conquest of Ireland by an English army.</p>
<p>Jones travelled to Westminster to present these findings to parliament, described a general massacre of innocent English and Scottish Protestant settlers but savage and cruel papists, convincing MPs of the need for action.</p>
<p>Parliament passed the Aventurers&rsquo; Act to raise money for a military campaign using 2,500,000 acres of forfeited Irish land as collateral. Under pressure to crush the rebellion as soon as possible Charles agreed to sign the act on the basis of the assumption of the unconditional defeat of the rebels.</p>
<p>One of those charged with organising the relief efforts was the obscure MP Oliver Cromwell, who sat on a number of key parliamentary committees dealing with the rebellion throughout 1642, he also devoted £600 of his own money (Ó Siocrú 29 - 30)</p>
<p>After some initial successes the rebels were on the defensive by early 1642. Phelim&rsquo;s efforts to capture Drogheda failed, exposing his limitations as a military commander and the irregular rebel forces were poorly armed and lacked military training. The Lords Justices, buoyed by reinforcements from England and the promise of a Scottish intervention, adopted an increasingly aggressive strategy, declaring any commander could execute any pillager rebel or traitor, inviting attacks on civilians.</p>
<p>Lord Moore subsequently murdered 140 men women and children in the vicinity of Dublin. Contrary to early modern convention women were specifically targeted as being responsible for stirring up their husbands (Ó Siocrú 31),</p>
<p>This offensive was halted by he death of the most energetic colonial commanders Coote and St Leger as well as outbreaks of flux and war between the king and parliament in August 1642.</p>
<p>The native Irish and old English sought to regain the initiative and re-establish law and order, the collection of subsidies and the support of the Catholic church by creating a confederate association.</p>
<p>The confederacy was based at the centre of rebel-controlled territory in Kilkenny. A legislative General Assembly, similar to the Dublin parliamentm would debate the war and peace while an Executive Supreme Council assumed responsibility for the daily functions of government. Provincial and county councils extended confederate authority throughout the localities while standing provincial armies replaced the irregular levies. It was effectively a parallel government, raising taxes and maintaining armies, minting coins, sending envoys to foreign courts (Ó Siocrú 32).</p>
<p>There were historic tensions between the Old English and native Irish but both sides made great efforts to preserve ethnic harmony; the General Assembly ordered that no distinction e made between old Irish, and old and new English or between clans or families. They had come together as Catholics but declared themselves committed to an inclusive form of national identity, calling on the king to treat all Irish subjects equally before the law, with place of birth rather than blood being the essential criterion for membership of an Irish nation.</p>
<p>As a confederate delegation explained during peace talks with the royalists in 1644: &lsquo;for he that is born in Ireland, though his parents and all his ancestors were aliens, nay if his parents are Indians or Turks, if converted to Christianity, is an Irishman as fully as if his ancestors were born here for thousands of years&rsquo; (Ó Siocrú 33).</p>
<p>Initially the administration in Dublin, staffed by English parliamentary sympathisers, rejected all peace overtures from Kilkenny. Unable to sustain a military offensive, the Lords Justices consolidated control of enclaves around Dublin, Cork and Derry, launching occasional offensives in defense of specific outposts.</p>
<p>However, word came that the crown desired a peace settlement to free soldiers up to confront parliament, which the Lords Justices reissted in favour of wiping the population out. The commander of the colonial forces, James Butler, earl of Ormond, was a royalist and suspected of sympathising with the confederates. With the support of Charles I Ormond seized Dublin for the royalist cause, removing the Lords Justice from office and establishing lines of communication with Kilkenny (Ó Siocrú 35 - 6).</p>
<p>With the outbreak of hostilities Irish and Scottish veterans on the continent returned to fight at home and were shocked by the brutality of the warfare, the imposition of military command increasingly moderated the behaviour of the troops (Ó Siocrú 37).</p>
<p>This opened up a space for political dialogue; in September 1643 the confederates and royalists agreed to a truce, enabling Ormond to ship troops back to assist the king in England. For three years the two sides engaged in negotiations seeking a settlement that would allow them to unite their forces against the English parliament and the Scottish covenanters who had signed their own treaty, the Solemn League and Covenant, in September 1643.</p>
<p>There were two main blocs at Kilkenny, the peace faction of existing landowners which favoured a limited settlement guaranteeing religious toleration, preservation of their estates and access to public office and a clerical faction, convinced the confederate leadership would not insist on major religious or political concessions and demanded the full restoration of the Catholic church.</p>
<p>They were supported by General Owen Roe O&rsquo;Neill. As a returnee, he tended to be more radical and supported more comprehensive land settlements to recover lost territory. Internal tensions increased with the arrival of a papal nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini appointed by Pope Innocent X, who was horrified that Protestant services continued to be held in Confederate towns (Ó Siocrú 39 - 40)</p>
<p>The royalists were defeated in Scotland and Sir Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell crushed the king&rsquo;s forces at Naseby in June 1645, the first major triumph of the New Model Army. Charles I surrendered to the Scottish covenanting army at Newark in Nottinghamshire in May 1646, ending the war in England. The king spent two years negotiating with parliament while trying to create a new royalist alliance from supporters in England, Ireland and Scotland (Ó Siocrú 45)</p>
<p>In late July 1646 the marquis of Ormond proclaimed peace with the Catholic confederates. Although too late to intervene in the English civil war, Ormond hoped to force concessions from parliament by threatening royalist / confederate invasion from Ireland.</p>
<p>The peace treaty granted many of the political and economic concessions sought by the confederates, including guarantees for estates, but postponed any decisions on religion until after the king regained his liberty. This compromise satisfied the moderate landowning faction but outraged the clerics, led by Rinuccini, who condemned the treaty as contrary to the confederate oath of association and excommunicated those who favoured peace with the royalists.
Backed by Owen Roe O&rsquo;Neill Rinuccini staged a coup and ordered him O&rsquo;Neill to march to Dublin against Ormond, but the offensive was delayed allowing Nicholas Plunkett, a moderate, to dictate policy (Ó Siocrú 46).</p>
<p>Royalist Scots mobilised an army and invaded England, prompting royalists to stage a series of uprisings. In August the New Model Army, led by Cromwell, inflicted a crushing blow on this army at Preston and in Edinburgh a regime sympathetic to parliament took power.</p>
<p>The second civil war radicalised political opinion, with parliamentary and army circles demanding the king be put on trial. This forced the confederates to come to terms.</p>
<p>When Charles was executed Ormond and the Scottish covenanters in Edinburgh declared the dead monarch&rsquo;s son Charles Stuart Prince of Wales king of Scotland, England and Ireland and the parliamentarians prepared for an offensive on Ireland out of revenge for 1641 and out a need to shore up the popularity of the parliament, which had discreditd itself against the king against native Irish barbarism and popery (Ó Siocrú 62).</p>
<p>English cavaliers supported to Ormond in the hope of restoring the Stuart dynasty and receiving lucrative positions though they viewed each other with suspicion. The southern parts of Munster, contained a significant concentration of Protestant settlers, their commander Lord Inchiquin had sided with the parliament initially but now switched to the king, due to the radicalism of the parliamentarians; Protestant concern with Catholic clergy and Catholics with the Protestants steadily undermined the fragile alliance. (Ó Siocrú 53 - 4)</p>
<p>On 13 August a fleet of 35 ships sailed to Dublin. Henry Ireton and 77 ships departed from Milford Haven for the southern coast to find out of any Munster ports would declare for parliament. Finding out that they did not, course was changed to Dublin (Ó Siocrú 78 - 9)</p>
<p>Cromwell planned for a campaign against the town of Drogheda, 30 miles to the north of the capital, to open the way to Ulster while the New Model Army marched into former confederate heartland in Kilkenny. Cromwell also forbade soldiers from harming civilians to retain order in Dublin (Ó Siocrú 79).</p>
<p>Ormond wanted to fortify Drogheda to embroil the parliamentarians in a protracted siege and give the royalists time to re-assemble an army, but the regimental commanders holding the city disagreed, arguing for a tactical withdrawal. Ultimately the walls were not constructed to take cannon fire and the lack of cavalry made it impossible to get supplies (Ó Siocrú 80).</p>
<p>Cromwell justified the massacre as the judgement of God on the barbarous Irish, making no discrimination between who was actually in control of Drogheda during the 1640s or the English and Irish Protestants who were killed. What made and makes Drogheda controversial was the extent of the killing; no prisoners were taken, no attempts at ransom, it was an historically unprecedented war of extermination; the extent of the assacre prompted Dundalk, Newry and Carlingford to surrender (Ó Siocrú 84 - 5).</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses attest that many men women and children were similarly killed in an assault on Wexford (Ó Siocrú 97).</p>
<p>Cromwell&rsquo;s arrival in Ireland prompted Owen Roe O&rsquo;Neill to to reconcile with Ormond; he agreed to serve under Ormond at the head of an army of 6,000 infantry and 800 cavalry.</p>
<p>The New Model Army&rsquo;s arrival increased desertion rates of Irish Protestants from the royalists&rsquo; army and his advance into Munster, risking an encounter with Ormond&rsquo;s superior army and a harsh winter, prompted Youghal, Cork and Kinsale to repudiate Ormond&rsquo;s authority altogether, providing Cromwell&rsquo;s army with army quarters and ports to receive supplies and new recruits (Ó Siocrú 98 - 101).</p>
<p>Royalists experienced significant difficulties in supply lines and O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s advance was delayed due to ailing health. He diedat Cloughoughter Castle in County Cavan, depriving the Catholics of their most successful military commander and the only general with the skills and experience to challenge the parliamentarians.</p>
<p>Ormond failed to take advantage of an opportunity to capitalise on divided parliamentary forces; in an attempt to cross the Barrow they had divided to work on bridges, rather than destroying these bridges Ormon hoped supply lines and illness would eat into enemy forces (Ó Siocrú 103).</p>
<p>Cromwell instead succeeded in taking the entire eastern northern and southern coastlines with the exception of Waterford and Duncannon and the royalists continually postponed facing him in the field and tenuous alliances between Catholic and Protestants were weakening especially as increasing numbers held Ormond responsible for the miltiary disasters and giving important position to English rather than Irish recruits, prompting demoralisation, desertions, towns refusing garrisons (Ó Siocrú 108).</p>
<p>Much of this came from personal distaste for Ormond and his policies; Irish Protestants distrusted the marquis because of his leniency towards Catholics who accused him of withholding vital religious concessions; Ormond did distribute important posts more among his family friends and new arrivals from England (Ó Siocrú 109 - 10).</p>
<p>Cromwell ignored calls to return to England to lead a pre-emptive strike against the Scottish covenanters who were negotiating with the exiled Prince Charles and divided his forces into three columns to mop up garrisons in Munster and Leinster to isolate Clonmel and Kilkenny and then take Waterford and Limerick. They were assisted by a mild winter and a steady supply of supplies and manpower from England; amounts which completely dwarfed what Ormond had available; each loss of territory inflicted further damage on their tax base (Ó Siocrú 118)</p>
<p>Cromwell&rsquo;s advance unnverved the royalist garrisons across Munster and secured surrender terms at Tipperary, the garrison at Cashel fled. Cromwell then took Kilkenny, moved towards Clonmel, with Ormond preferring to reinforce Limerick which was not under threat (Ó Siocrú 119 - 123).</p>
<p>Hugh Dubh O&rsquo;Neill set up a narrow killing zone around the breach Cromwell made in Clonmel&rsquo;s wall, repelled the cavalry then left the garrison under cover of night. Cromwell pursued the column and cut them down (Ó Siocrú 124 - 5).</p>
<p>On 8 March the bishops presented a list of demands to Ormond which complained of a lack of Catholic appointments to the army and called for a major re-structuring of civil and military government with greater power to the bishops; the cities also wanted a freer hand to negotiate a separate peace from Cromwell.</p>
<p>The oyalists collapsed completely after an offensive by Bishop McMahon, a leading figure of the confederate association representing Ulster on the Supreme Council throughout with 1640s with no military experience.</p>
<p>William Petty&rsquo;s survey shows Cromwell confiscated eleven million acres, more than half of the island&rsquo;s landmass.</p>
<p>In 1652 the English government decreed that settled areas must be cleared of native Irish. An act of 1653 banished all indigenous Irish whether innocent or guilty to barren lands west of the Shannon River; the average adventurer held 700 acres after Cromwell&rsquo;s settlement.</p>
<p>However even under pasturage estates required substantial numbers of workers; most settlers wanted Irish tenants who would take less wages and pay higher rents than English settlers adventurers desired cheap Irish labourers who would pay higher rents than English settlers, some dispossessed Irish stayed in the east to work the estates of the new owners.</p>
<p>The English intermittently attempted to shape economic development by dispossessing Catholic merchants and replacing them with Protestants, giving town patrons were given grants to hold markets and fairs.</p>
<p>These schemes, designed to attract tradespeople, were only moderately successful. The more organic pre-plantation towns, by contrast, grew stronger with systems of administration and commerce, courts and local political institutions based on corporate guilds. Apart from Belfast and Dublin which were dominated by Protestants, most towns were dominated by indigenous Irish and Anglo-Irish Catholics, seen as unreliable.</p>
<p>Cromwell barred Catholics from local government and merchant trades and physically removed them from Irish towns. Byelaws disenfranchised people who did not speak Irish and did not attend Protestant worship; Catholics were barred from local government, citizens who used Irish dress language and other customs were subject to degrading punishments (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 43).</p>
<p>Later Penal Laws extended this discrimination further; acts of 1695 and 1704 disarmed Catholics, prevented them from going abroad for schooling holding property or entering the professions (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 44).</p>
<p>English law had been replaced by Brehon law first in the Pale in the twelfth century but only in the seventeenth was it made illegal (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 42).</p>
<p>English incorporation of Irish land was completed after 1689 when William III defeated the Jacobites in the western front of England&rsquo;s European war. After the Willimate victory those who failed to support William were indicted for &lsquo;high treason&rsquo; and their lands were confiscated and transferred to settlers.</p>
<p>Catholic share of land fell from 59% in 1641 to 22% in 1688, 14% in 1703 and 5% by 1776. Catholics lost 6 million of the 6.5 million acres they owned in 1641 (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 40 - 1).</p>
<p>This further centralised Dublin as a centre of economic, legal and political order in Ireland with administration, education and other state functions being concentrated there (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 45).</p>
<p>As part of Britain&rsquo;s attempts to wrest maritime hegemony from the Dutch Ireland was prevented from trading directly with Europe or the continent. Irish producers were also forced into producing commodities and services crucial to England&rsquo;s Atlantic project such as armaments and provisions (O&rsquo;Hearn 2015 45 - 7).</p>
<p>Profit on Irish land was derived by the shipping of livestock to England (as well as salted provisions to the West Indies to feed slaves); Ireland&rsquo;s cattle and sheep exports - exceeded size any similar trade in the world in the period - flooded Britain with low-cost pastoral products, squeezing the profits of England’s landed proprietors.</p>
<p>The Cattle Acts 1663 and 1667 excluded Irish produce from British markets, the woollen industry was excluded in 1669, so Ireland was integrated into the imperial system at the same time it was cut off from its markets, forcing it to specialise in products which benefitted British ones.</p>
<p>Garrisons and military networks were strengthened and the economy was restructured to align as closely as possible with the requirements of a military supply chain; wool, rope, uniforms, armaments. By 1845 it was the barracks for more troops than we stationed in imperial India (McCann 7).</p>
<p>Growth and development up to the early nineteenth century facilitated by:</p>
<p>i) the introduction of a potato crop which sustained a low-wage agrarian class which could subsist by cultivating land without any capital other than a spade and seed potatoes - surplus over families&rsquo; nutritional needs could be used to fatten pigs, fuelling population growth and declining mortality until an Gorta Mór</p>
<p>ii) eastern and coastal areas tied into British mercantilism</p>
<p>iii) wool, linen cotton industries in the north; domestic production by skilled weavers in these rural hinterlands was possible due to Ulster custom, which provided security against rack-renting. As this industry mechanised it moved to Belfast but declined by the emergence of large factories in England in the course of the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The Act of Union between England and Ireland was introduced in January 1801 after the United Irishmen rebellion, from that point on the indigenous economic system was forced into a more centralised laissez-faire trading system dominated by London; Irish stewardship over the Irish economy was ended and the relative autonomy of the Irish parliament was subsumed by London under a compliant Anglo-Irish aristocracy. Undergirding the act of union was a fear of the influence of Jacobinism in Ireland and the need to subdue an increasingly politicised Irish nation.</p>
<p>This provoked a rebellion led by Robert Emmet, Thomas Rusell and Thomas Emmett, which decreed a republic that would revoke the union, abolish tithes, transfer all Church land to the new nation, universal suffrage. The rebellion was suppressed and Emmett was hung, drawn and quartered (McCann 5 - 6).</p>
<p>Demand for labour-extensive cattle and sheep grazing overtook that which existed for barley, wheat and potatoes, driving people off the land, concentrating farming and reducing the number of people earning money from agriculture; for the vast majority of the population the new order was one of socio-cultural domination and poverty.</p>
<p>A decline in Irish industry set in as English industry centralised and increasingly benefitted from economies of scale textiles moved to  Glasgow and Lancashire, milling, brewing, iron-founding, shipbuilding, rope, paper and glass-making moved to Britain, raising unit costs, depressing Irish demand and putting out cottage industries, increasing emigration.</p>
<p>There was also pressure on Irish grain, since Britain was also able to buy at lower grain prices after the repeal of the corn laws, the context in which An Gorta Mór broke out when the potato crops failed in 1817, 1821, 1829, and most of the 1830s, destroying the staple food of the underclass, significantly reducing the population by starvation and emigration, outcomes which were exacerbated by unemployment and lack of sufficient landholdings among the rural poor. It should be noted that there was no absolute shortage of food, but unemployment and lack of access sufficient land among the rural poor.</p>
<p>Belfast was the one industrial centre that survived, becoming the largest centre of linen manufacturing in the world from the mid nineteenth century. Linkages to engineering sectors were established; steam engines boiler-making, all important to building iron ships, machines for the preparation and spinning of flax.</p>
<p>In the post-independence period there were a number of attempts to use interventionist strategies to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s weak manufacturing sector. These did not involve the state taking any active role in production, rather they took the form of subsidies.</p>
<p>Protectionist measures succeeded in increasing employment and outward engagement with the US, Britain or Germany, delivering economic growth, but did not succeed in raising output to the extent needed to absorb labour surpluses or raise raise living standards.</p>
<p>Production also remained unsophisticated; there were no linkages developed between multinationals and indigenous firms.</p>
<p>This is a pattern familiar to colonial contexts, which tend to be developmental latecomers; in developing their own industries they are working against significant barriers to entry in a crowded world market in which many firms have extensive product differentiation, ownership over proprietary technology, brand identification and larger capital investments; latecomers have difficulty developing initial fixed and variable capital investments necessary for entering into markets.</p>
<p>In order to better understand this phenomenon Dieter Senghaas derives two models of development from Samir Amin; auto-centric development in established core states versus dependent development in peripheral zones.</p>
<p>In auto-centric economies development can happen independently of the periphery, but but not the other way around.</p>
<p>The quintessential example of an auto-centric economy is the postwar mass production / consumption model in the postwar US, subsequently exported to Western Europe. Here there is a strong connection between the production of means of consumption and mass consumption goods, allowing for the flourishing of a domestic market.</p>
<p>The domestic market in peripheral economies is limited and industrial connections arise for the purposes of export.</p>
<p>In an auto-centric model basic needs of the broad masses, such as food, housing, education and culture are provided to a greater extent; overall this means that there is a tendency for standards of living to rise.</p>
<p>Peripheral development is therefore a vicious circle that inhibits development, though it should be noted that this does not prevent growth.</p>
<p>In applying Amin’s concept to Europe in the the early nineteenth century Senghaas finds that Eastern, Southern and Scandinavian nations have been exposed to similar pressures and forced to export single products in a world market dominated by larger powers but over time these succeeded in escaping the vicious circle, against Amin’s claim that delinking from the world economy and the creation of regional common markets was necessary to development.</p>
<p>It seems auto-centric development is therefore possible via liberal association with the world-market by state intervention, regulating foreign investments, retaining possession of natural resources; Ireland&rsquo;s policy however, has been pure association, largely due to being colonised by Britain.</p>
<p>Decolonisation, land reforms and mobilisation of a nationalist separatist movement benefitting certain groups instead of the broad masses also repeats patterns seen in other colonial contexts. In Ireland these were the graziers, who benefitted from land reforms agitated for by Parnell and the Land League; the breaking up of large untenanted estates allowed them to accumulate more land but now acted as a block on any further reforms which might have facilitated the development of an industrial or manufacturing base; these dominant classes seek to conserve and remove the impediments to the further development of a social order established by the metropolitan powers.</p>
<p>The prerequisites for industrialisation seemed present at independence; low taxation, absence of national debt, no heavy burden of military spending, large external capital reserves, extensive banking system, highly literacy, labour supply, extensive railway and communications network, a large proprietor class, but this did not happen.</p>
<p>We see this in the continuity that exists between the nominally independent Irish state apparatus and the administrative system established by the British; Catholic social teaching also undermined any efforts there might have been towards production organised by the state.</p>
<p>At first Irish trade relations with the UK were unrestrained; the Irish government considered free trade a precondition of stability. This aligned well with better off farm-interests that dominated Cumann na nGael.</p>
<p>When Fianna Fáil came into office they initiated a protectionist policy to reduce economic dependence on Britain to provide employment and reduce emigration, more in line with the interests of the working class and small farmers and succeeded in creating employment through import substitution; also aligning with a trajectory followed by third-world countries&rsquo; import-substitution strategies later in the century.</p>
<p>The share of Irish live agricultural exports increased and the share of manufacturing exports declined during the interwar period and remained low until the fifties, indicating Irish exporters&rsquo; inability to increase the share of products with higher value added.</p>
<p>Import substitution therefore only succeeded in changing the character of Ireland’s foreign dependence rather than ending it, since employment and consumption depended on an ability to import; Ireland, unlike all other European nations, did not succeed in developing a well-functioning national system of innovation in this period.</p>
<p>The US offered Marshall Aid to Europe to secure markets for US exports and establish Western Europe as a free trade bulwark against Communist expansion. Ireland was offered aid, acceptance of which was favoured by an Atlanticist wing in the state apparatus, but opposed by others who still favoured a deflationist policy continuity with British fiscal policies; the Bank of England remained highly influential in Irish financial policymaking and the British government was keen to limit dollar imports.</p>
<p>US officials emphasised the investments be productive rather than purchases of British or other securities; the IDA, a constellation of export boards and grant schemes were the result.</p>
<p>In 1948 restrictions on imports were rolled back, partly because of Fine Gael coming into power, partly due to external pressure from the OEEC. A record balance of payments deficits led to the introduction of deflationary measures which triggered recessions throughout the fifties: Ireland sacrificed the right to afford protection by quota when it was most needed.</p>
<p>Imports of capital goods and other advanced goods that could not be produced domestically continued to grow and a small home market, negligible exports reduced the possibility of developing industry to the point of producing more advanced industrial goods; we see a similar trajectory in former colonies in Latin America, Asia and Africa over the course of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In the late fifties a strategy of export-led industrialisation was embarked upon. O’Hearn reads this as Ireland prioritising the interests of the US, the IMF and transnational corporations, this does not make Ireland distinct in a European context in and of itself; the degree to which Ireland’s indigenous productive capacity was still constrained does.</p>
<p>Ireland&rsquo;s industrialisation by invitationhad three components:</p>
<p>i) substantial capital grants and tax concessions to export-oriented manufacturing</p>
<p>ii) the attraction of foreign manufacturing enterprise, again aimed at exports
iii) the dismantling of protection in return for greater access to markets abroad</p>
<p>The first element relied on a complex of state-sponsored bodies with the IDA as the core. The Industrial Grants Act of 1959 set up grant boards which established industrial estates with advanced factories; grants were apportioned according to shares of plant / machine building / land costs. There were also additional grants for training and R&amp;D. Competitiveness was a major condition for these grants; in practice only export-oriented firms received then.</p>
<p>A low corporation tax regime was introduced after an Export Profit Tax Relief Tax was abolished under EEC pressure, which gave a remission on the increment of profit exports over the previous year. The Industrial Development Act of 1958 contained further incentive, including waiving the Controls of Manufactures Act, enduring from the protectionist period. This was wholly repealed in 1964, meaning that there was now no restriction on foreign ownership and control, and no restraints on repatriation of profits. These arrangements put a considerable drain on State finances.</p>
<p>The attraction of foreign firms became a goal in itself, with the result that there was a direct inflow of foreign direct investment with only minor flow to indigenous Irish firms.</p>
<p>Free trade was a distinct, third element in the new Irish strategy. Quotas had been dismantled, but tariffs were still quite high in 1959, when the two
other elements of the strategy were in place. The move to free trade followed. Ireland was not interested in EFTA membership, since it gave no further advantages as its manufacturing production, however small, had free access to the British market.</p>
<p>Following Britain, Ireland applied for EC membership in 1961. A Commission on Industrial Organisation and adaptation councils were established to prepare for freer trade but France vetoed English, and consequently Irish, membership.
Further tariff reductions were put through in 1963 and 1964. In December 1965 a full Anglo-Irish free trade area was established, according to which Ireland was to remove all protection against British manufacturing imports.</p>
<p>From January 1973, Ireland agreed to remove all protection against EC manufacturing industry, adding a layer of foreign multinational firms to the Irish industrial structure and making Ireland uniquely dependent on multinational firms, which were attracted not by favourable natural resources but extraordinarily generous government subsidies, grants and export tax reliefs on the Irish state&rsquo;s dime.</p>
<p>Ireland can sustain higher wages than many third-world host countries, since its favourable location and political reliability reducing uncertainty for foreign investors.</p>
<p>Production became more technically complex and manufacturing more export oriented, improving industrial performance, again only weak links to a domestic manufacturing industry which remains low skill, without R&amp;D, high import content, low value added and an absence of capital goods production [this was written in the 90s, not sure if this remains true]</p>
<p>Raymond Crotty argues the fundamental reason for Ireland’s underdevelopment is the continuing influence of colonial capitalism; the imposition of structural and institutional defects, though it should be noted that his definition of idiosyncratic; from Crotty&rsquo;s point of view capitalism is an organic and adequate social formation in other Western European states due to patterns of ancient agrarian civilisation established 7000 years ago: irrelevant to modern accumulation and state formation.</p>
<p>In any case: one of the ways in which Crotty indicates Ireland&rsquo;s apparent divergence from third-world economies while sharing their substances is emigration, preventing the development of crowded cities full of un or underemployed people; we also have a relatively high per capita income share and wage levels.</p>
<p>Crotty’s argument does not depend on ideas of unequal exchange drived from dependency but rather distinguished between places where capitalism developed organically out of cattle-raising societies rather than being imposed on tribal society to which capital intensive agriculture is alien, as well as dubious arguments that the state, rather than class composition, determines mode of accumulation.</p>

			<title>Why ‘Stephen Hero’ is better than ‘A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man’</title>

			<description>I do not quite believe that Stephen Hero is a better novel than A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Reading Stephen Hero at a significant remove from Portrait convinced me that it could be, for the reason that we get far more frequent and more extensive insights into what Joyce’s actual line on social and national questions might be, but having gone back to Portrait to check I can confirm that the latter is correctly regarded as the better work.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I do not quite believe that Stephen Hero is a better novel than A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Reading Stephen Hero at a significant remove from Portrait convinced me that it could be, for the reason that we get far more frequent and more extensive insights into what Joyce’s actual line on social and national questions might be, but having gone back to Portrait to check I can confirm that the latter is correctly regarded as the better work.</p>
<p>However, there were a few points that I thought were worth reflecting on, at the risk of falling victim to a tendency within literary studies to treat everything, including what Joyce crossed off the page, as an object of study. This is particularly troublesome to me because in my view, Joyce was not a writer who benefitted from lots of people telling him he could do no wrong.</p>
<p>I have already written about some of my frustrations with Joyce’s elisions of Irish politics and what a shame it is that a truly great Irish novelist, whose writing career aligns with an unprecedented period of social convulsion in Ireland, barely reflects this in his work. It is instead necessary to look to non-fictive writings for direct treatments of the Rising, or wade through layers of irony in the Cyclops episode of Ulysses to figure out what he thought of British imperialism. While glimpses emerge in Finnegans Wake, I would contend that Joyce’s final work has far more to say about Europe and Ireland in the nineteenth century, the Napoleonic wars and incendiary Fenianism, as opposed to the more disciplined manifestation that it had begun to assume at the time Joyce was writing. The section of Finnegans Wake in which Ireland and the cultural revival is dealt with at its greatest length, comes through in the section about Joyce’s prosthesis, Shem the Penman, his grappling with his own impulse to write, his ambivalence with Ireland and flight from nationalist pieties. Again we think of the line in Ulysses in which Dedalus mentions that he is interested in Ireland as it is the place in which his genius happens to have landed.</p>
<p>The idea that Joyce is somewhat aloof from Ireland was, as I understand it, fully entrenched after Richard Ellmann’s biography  represented him as a writer of the metropole, with far more in common with Ibsen and Hauptmann than Yeats or Synge, who left the straightened  Catholicism and myopic cultural nationalism of Ireland behind in order to write in centres of European culture; Paris, Zurich and Trieste. With the rise of post-colonial criticism in the seventies, the idea that Joyce has things to say about Irish society and British domination began to come to the fore. When I studied Joyce in university, it was a very philosophical, post-structuralist and negative Joyce that I encountered there, though this may just have been a function of who was teaching me and where.</p>
<p>All this is part of the reason why I think Stephen Hero is worth reading. In style it recalls the naturalistic approach of Dubliners in which information and visual detail is rendered in a blank and almost dead way, into which we are encouraged to read no small amount of satirical venom but which we would not necessarily be able to pinpoint on the level of the word. On the one hand we have nothing that matches the quality of the section in Portrait in which Stephen has a vision of his personal hell, but it does mean that we get more serious treatments of political ideology and the nature of Irish society at the beginning of the twentieth century. Republicanism, the national movement’s comprehension of liberty, how it looked to France and Switzerland for civic models to emulate, how hurling is regarded as preparing Ireland’s young people for a looming military conflict, are all treated here and I find it really interesting how Stephen Hero troubles the antinomy of Irish Republicanism as provincial / European literature as internationalist, as those writing within the legacy of Ellmann regard it, whether they see themselves as doing so or not.</p>
<p>It is at the same time difficult to say that A Portrait would really miss them as they appear here, given the somewhat rote nature in which these sequences play out. These ideas are introduced in a very breathless manner by one of Stephen’s more naive classmates, Stephen gets the better of them by telling them if they want military training they should join the British Army, or informing them that prominent members of their movement are likely to accommodate themselves with the ruling order to come, ‘the publicans and the pawnbrokers who live on the miseries of the people’ whose business activities furthermore violate Catholic social teaching: ‘One of your professors in the Medical Science who teaches you Sanitary Science or Forensic Medicine os something — God knows what — is at the same time the landlord of a whole streetful of brothels not a mile away from where we are standing’. Everything here remains very much within the tradition of ‘needless to say, I had the last laugh’ of anecdote.</p>
<p>Another example of this is Temple, who is a nationalist and also from outside Dublin. His dialogue is represented with apostrophes and hyphens in some attempt to channel some rural ernacular or other:</p>
<p>‘—‘Scuse me, sir, said Temple to Stephen across the intervening bodies, do you believe in Jesus…I don’t believe in Jesus’</p>
<p>‘—‘Course I don’t know…if you believe in Jesus. I believe in Man…If you b’lieve in Jesus…of course..I oughtn’t’ to say anything the first time I met you…Do you think that?’</p>
<p>The ellipses are Joyce’s and the intention is as clear as it is in Middlemarch or Elizabeth Gaskell’s North and South,when more radical factory workers are represented as not really knowing what they are talking about or what’s best for them.</p>
<p>It should also be said that Stephen Hero has significantly more emotional range, it has far more humour, lust and grief and Stephen feels far more rounded out character-wise as a consequence. While Portrait brings us from early to late childhood, then adolescence and university, Stephen Hero is so focused on Stephen’s years in UCD it qualifies as a campus novel. Stephen and his friends lounge around, fruitlessly debate utopian socialism and talking the particular variety of aimless bollocks you do as a student outside the library, bantering about ‘red-arsed bees’ and how to convince yourself you are the son of God. There is also far more Emma Cleary but there is little here that feels like its missing from Portrait.</p>
<p>I have a vague recollection of some critic describing the section in which Stephen’s younger sister dies as sentimental, drawing a comparison between it and the death of Little Nell, but I personally found the section in which Stephen’s very devout mother explains to her daughter that death is nothing to be afraid of because she will be in heaven with God very powerful and I think does great work in showing how isolated Stephen has become in his attempt to fuse Nietzsche with scholasticism:</p>
<p>‘Life seemed to him a gift; the statement ‘I am alive’ seemed to him to contain a satisfactory certainty and many other things, held up as indubitable, seemed to him certain. His sister had enjoyed little more than the fact of life, few or none of its privileges. The supposition of an allwise God calling a soul home whenever it seemed good to Him could not redeem in his eyes the futility of her life’.</p>
<p>Sections such as these, which represent a small house in which someone is dying, trying to talk to them in a manner that does not broach what is really going on captures very well the feelings of a young man encountering death for the first time. This allows lofty social issues to become more personal; Stephen reads the Encyclopedia Britannica entry on socialism and decides that while commerce is just, rent-seeking is not. In a less virtuoso anticipation of Ulysses’ agenbite of inwit, in which Stephen reproaches himself for abandoning his younger siblings to their lives of deprivation, Stephen also considers the pitiful existences of Dublin’s working class:</p>
<p>‘These wanderings filled him with deep-seated anger and whenever he encountered a burly black-vested priest taking a stroll of pleasant inspection through these warrens full of swarming and cringing believers he cursed the farce of Irish Catholicism: an island the inhabitants of which entrust their wills and minds to others that they may ensure for themselves a life of spiritual paralysis’.</p>
<p>Ultimately Stephen recoils from such judgements in the next paragraph as unfit for one seeking to express themselves freely, a judgement and abdication that is shown to be justified by one such working class subject:</p>
<p>‘—On’y, said she, God bless the gintleman, he uses the words that you nor me can’t intarprit’.</p>

			<description>Most of these have been ripped off old VHS tapes which are themselves recordings of television broadcasts. The uploaders will have been conscientious enough to edit out the ad breaks, but sometimes they are left in. These are never quite as interesting as you expect them to be; none of them offer a very robust insight into the times in which they were broadcast, they are primarily noteworthy from the point of view of how orange television signals seemed to have been in the eighties and nineties.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of these have been ripped off old VHS tapes which are themselves recordings of television broadcasts. The uploaders will have been conscientious enough to edit out the ad breaks, but sometimes they are left in. These are never quite as interesting as you expect them to be; none of them offer a very robust insight into the times in which they were broadcast, they are primarily noteworthy from the point of view of how orange television signals seemed to have been in the eighties and nineties. The usual artefacts of video recordings also return; discolouration, especially at the edges, random lapses into black and white, the momentary appearance of a teal screen with the words TRACKING in the top left. The other videos the accounts have uploaded are highly miscellaneous, some will have an exclusively republican focus, others will have a more overtly socialist or working-class history slant, but most of them have no discernible theme at work at all. Bad recordings of live gigs, old RTÉ or UTV idents, randomly edited news footage, audiobooks.</p>
<p>An Tine Beo (1966) was commissioned by RTÉ as part of a commemorative program for the fiftieth anniversary of the 1916 Rising. The rising appears here mediated primarily through recollection and recordings of military testimony, which appear as narration over shots of relevant Dublin sites in the sixties; St. Stephen’s Green, Boland’s Mills, the GPO. Sometimes these streets are empty and the effect is sombre, the voices spectral reminders of a time when struggle against the British Empire took on a concrete form. The documentary locates the rising in the context of the United Irelanders, the 1913 lockout, the Gaelic cultural revival and the founding of the Irish citizen army.  The overall thrust is to locate the free state under Eamon DeValera, who appears behind his desk towards the end, as the culmination of these centuries of struggle. In line with this aim, rebel tunes are played throughout, but as stately  and tasteful orchestral scores over close up shots of Merrion Street’s neo-classical architecture, rather than as populist working-class ballads. We are offered a reminder that when in office DeValera put an end to the death penalty, a clear repudiation of the idea that the Cosgrave government can claim to be the first in the state.</p>
<p>As part of the Abbey Theatre’s commemorative programme in 2016, Fintan O’Toole interviewed Roddy Doyle about his novel A Star Called Henry (1999), which represented a young man from Dublin’s tenements, Henry Smart, as the Forest Gump of the free state. The novel is an irreverent one; it dabbles in magical realism, representing Smart as a big hit with Cumman na mBán brigades and having sex with some of them during crucial moments in the early history of the revolutionary period, in a bid to pour scorn on what we might refer to as ‘romantic nationalism’. I think we can trace this attitude or criticisms of it to Ruth Dudley Edwards’ accounts of figures like Padraig Pearse, who is spoken of as more akin to a suicide visionary or religious extremist than an anti-imperialist. Doyle also recalls episodes from his childhood in school when they were required to learn the names of the participants in 1916, glorify the Fenian dead, have teatowels with their likenesses on them, etc etc. Snapshots of this also appear in Doyle’s more autobiographical novel Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (1993). What Doyle seems to object to here is the idea that there is a lineage stretching from Cú Chulainn to Wolfe Tone to Pearse, that the history of struggle against the British Empire forms a totality. I’m not exactly sure why it is de facto regarded as a bad thing to identify the commonalities in struggles waged by the Young Irelanders, the Fenians and the Irish Citizen Army, I prefer to think of the history of Ireland’s solidarity with smaller nations as something to be proud of or celebrated, as in the Dunnes Stores strikes against apartheid, or the reasons why Israeli ambassadors speak openly about what a difficult mission Ireland is in comparison to other states. One of the reasons I can think of in accounting for why it is that Irish writers seem to keen to write this stuff off is revisionism’s capacity to present itself as introducing greater amounts of nuance or intellectual credibility to the wholesale rejection of imperialism, John Banville speaks in very similar terms in his positive appraisal of Roy Foster’s Vivid Faces (2014) which reads the revolutionary generation as bourgeois and anti-democratic narodniki. There are certainly shots of graves, Cú Chulainn’s statue in An Tine Bheo, but in large part the aim of the documentary is to lay such ghosts to rest, incarnate the living spirit of Republicanism in Dev and replace the haunted streets with images of a bustling metropolis. It concludes with full streets, buses, commuters and a voice assuring us that we have ‘paid our debts’, setting the stage for an economic model premised on foreign direct investment. Easter 1916: A Curious Journey was also commissioned for the fiftieth anniversary, but focuses to a greater extent on the actuality of the struggles and its participants. These veterans are equally divided into treatyites and anti-treatyites and important junctures for both camps seems to have been the assassination of Michael Collins (though Tom Barry is not asked about this) as well as the familiar bitterness of the civil war, whose wounds are still evident, bringing more than one participant to tears. A Curious Journey emphasises to a greater extent than An Tine Bheo, the trajectory towards a United Ireland and the anti-sectarian nature of republicanism as envisioned by Wolfe Tone. Partition is identified as a mistake and a causal factor in the ongoing failures of both the Irish state and the northern statelet, but the actuality of getting there is not touched upon to any great extent.</p>
<p>A Sense of Loss (1972) was directed by Marcel Ophuls and seems to have been filmed in a pre-Bloody Sunday milieu and it therefore affords significantly greater amounts of attention to the Officials than the Provisionals. Ophuls’ approach is an exercise in a kind of a high irony; he poses disinterested yet often deeply challenging questions to everyone he interviews, whether loyalist or republican, military or civilian and manages in that intensely subtle way great interviewers can to get people to reveal themselves in ways I find it hard to think that they intended. Loyalist families say there is no such thing as housing or job discrimination in the orange state and that it would solve everything if Britain annexed and re-occupied the twenty-six counties. This can be over-egged at times; a lot goes into the juxtaposition of families talking about loved ones they’ve lost in the conflict while Irish-American marching bands proceed down a New York street or shots of dolls in military regalia hang in a toy shop. It is difficult to shake the sense that Ophuls is significantly more sympathetic to the republican side of the argument, his random interviews in London reveals the British to be totally ignorant about the roots of the conflict and an RUC man instructs him to interview moderate Protestants for his documentary, presumably knowing people like Patrick Ruddell or John McKeague (the latter filmed sitting between two portraits of Elizabeth II and in front of one of William of Orange) will have no qualms about describing Catholics as ‘gutter rats’ or argue that songs with lyrics like ‘Falls was made for burning / Taigs were made to kill’ do not encourage or celebrate pogroms against Catholics; ‘we were acquitted on this charge’. Ophuls’ documentary remains one of the few which affords significant consideration to loyalism and the facts of the ideology as explained by its adherents render it difficult to present as just another side of one argument.</p>
<p>No Go (1973) is likewise focused on the officials, but is concentrated primarily in Derry. The documentary’s narrator is Irish-American, everything Irish people say is subtitled and much of the documentary’s soundtrack is composed of ballads which gesture towards the Officials’ supposedly more Marxist outlook which glazes in it a bit of a sentimental pall. The film’s high points are footage of training camps, where a few young men are screamed at for not dropping into a sniper’s position or holding their rifles correctly. Representations of the Bogside as under siege are also very well done with barbed wire, barricades, terraced houses, overseen by snipers between gaps in sandbag walls, facilitated by Derry’s geography. From the point of view of the young men who are interviewed, joining the IRA was either a matter of having been born into it, with one’s father being a member, or an imperative due to the need to protect the community from British forces, or, as another reports, seeing an unarmed teenage girl shot by a British Army officer. A now-familiar account of the IRA’s growth and development is laid out here, from the disproportionate reaction of the RUC to civil rights protesters, to Bloody Sunday, to a lack of economic opportunity for Catholics. A political account of the provisional movement receives short shrift here, an Official presents them as single-minded militarists with no political content to their approach whatsoever. Such lines are continually propagated by the bafflingly resilient stickie-historiographical industrial complex, but as Gearóid Ó Faoleán documents in his book A Broad Church (2019), the split in the IRA was articulated in manifestly different ways in a number of different areas depending on far more pragmatic and local causes than are usually discussed, such as personalities, group affiliation, the capacity of one side of the organisation to mobilise or arm itself in one area as opposed to another. Tyrone in particular represents an exception to many simplistic narratives of provo bible bashers on one hand versus dialectical materialists on the other. No Go also features a B plot wherein an explosive device is manufactured, smuggled across the border and bypasses a British Army checkpoint. Strange dubs clearly undertaken by yanks are used in these reconstructions (‘this will blow away these Pratastant haethans!’) and it is difficult to know what the point of these scenes are. We also see the fallout from the Officials’ shooting of William Best, a teenage soldier in the British Army, and the role his assassination played in galvanising a peace movement in the area, especially by priests who are calling for a universal end to violence. I recall Mary Holland’s documentary Creggan (1980), no longer on YouTube, that represents residents of the Bogside as surprisingly willing to say on record that though Best’s death was regrettable from one point of view, he should not have been in the British Army.</p>
<p>The Patriot Game (1978) emphasises to a far greater extent than elsewhere the political program of the provos. The documentary offers the closest to a Marxist account of the Troubles that yet exists on film, a history stretching as far back as the plantations, through the United Irishmen, the efforts of James Connolly, and to a lesser extent Jim Larkin, to fuse republican and socialist struggle into a single coherent movement. An account of how the partition of Ireland facilitated the construction of the orange state, to which the civil rights movement emerged as a response in the late sixties and how this peaceful protests were in turn responded to by heavy-handed police tactics, consisting of internment, as well torture administered in police custody (electric shocks, drugging, sleep deprivation, beatings, sometimes administered to death, the use of supposedly ‘non-lethal’ weapons) re-vivified the IRA; all this is identified with a broader history of colonial settlement and decolonial struggle. It is likewise attentive to the ways in which the British conducted counter-insurgency operations, bomb alerts passed onto the police on Bloody Friday were not being acted on and special branch both assisted and facilitated loyalist paramilitaries in their efforts to collapse Sunningdale.</p>
<p>The original footage which appears here is shot roughly in black and white. We move through housing estates with children playing, while patrols of armed British soldiers and convoys of military trucks drive by. It’s here that we see something like a recognisable aesthetic of the Troubles take shape, the particular kind of grain that alerts you to the possibility that something in the foreground will be blowing up very soon. One hesitates to apply the concept of the uncanny to these films, signs of youth culture, kids playing in housing estates co-existing with British army patrols, convoys of military trucks, but that it prompted a particular kind of prurience lying behind takes about what the imminent American civil war will look like is undeniable. If one were interested in such things, one might try to re-read Mark Fisher’s notion of hauntology is a more overtly political light here; British council estates populated by Irish people, main arteries marched down by a seventeenth-century union of craft workers and thereby put the mourning for what Fisher refers to as the British ‘postwar consensus’, which was in fact deeply contested, not least in Ireland, under significant amounts of pressure. Provos appear in silhouette assembling guns, drilling, outlining the program for a 32-county socialist republic as well as the Éire Nua scheme. The molecular nature of revolution also receives attention here, self-organised nationalist communities form taxi associations in response to the government removing bus services from Catholic areas.</p>
<p>A friend of mine recently made the point that the history of Irish struggle is not rife with great speeches. Ruairí O’Brádaigh’s address to a Sinn Féin ard-fheis in 1986 does not quite count as one of them, but the passion with which it is delivered as well as its hitting the reformist trajectory of Sinn Féin point for point means that I am compelled to watch it on a regular basis. O’Brádaigh opens his address with a reference to Adams’ media strategising (‘I shake hands with everyone and at every time not just in front of the media’) and draws on the history of the republican movement to rebuke the idea that recognising partitionist parliaments is anything other than a turn towards parliamentarism and reformism:</p>
<p>“The destabilisation of the state, we are told, will result and the movement will be strengthened. Always has it been otherwise, every time has it been otherwise, the movement suffered and the state was strengthened. Four times since 1922 it happened, all ended in failure and ended ultimately in the degradation and shame of collaborating with the British, of handing over our political prisoners to them and running counter to what they originally set out to do.”</p>
<p>McGuinness speaks in favour of the motion O’Bradaigh speaks against and is laughable in its evasions of the point, insistence that SF will never do any of the things it ended up doing and renders emotive comparisons with the bourgeoning split and that of the Officials/Provisionals in the seventies.</p>
<p>Some account of the social and economic milieu of the north emerge in Irish Ways (1989) including how important the securitisation of the six counties is for creating employment for the loyalist population, we are shown bullet holes in walls and ceilings of Catholic homes, that Ballymurphy has an 80% unemployment rate, we hear a woman describing how a British soldier blinded her with a rubber bullet by shooting her in the face. In overall terms though, it represents a pivot in the ways in which the troubles are represented in documentaries, which begin to take a ‘two sides’ version of the conflict for granted. The Republican end is represented by Brendan Hughes, hunger striker and member of the Provisional IRA while Gusty Spence and David Irvine form the UVF contrast to Hughes in Irish Ways and Voices from the Grave respectively. What makes the difference here then is the way in which the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Ulster Volunteer Force are taken seriously as political organisations in their own right. Spence advances a brief analysis of the history of the north according to the idea that Irish republicanism was always a murderous and dissident force against the neutral ‘state’ represented by the plantations, sadly the documentary does not expand on this Kaiserreich version of early modern Irish history to any great extent. For some of the reasons touched upon above, even in these accounts it is always Republicanism that commands greater amounts of attention. There’s a clip of Michael Stone in The Enemy Within (1990) talking about how he always regretted how Republicans were much better at prison propaganda than loyalists were, which leaves you wondering what exactly a paramilitary arm of the existing state could actually be propagandising for.</p>
<p>Voices from the Grave (2010) goes into further detail on Hughes’ biography, due to their being based off oral testimony Ed Moloney collected in the course of his Boston Tapes research. Hughes talks about growing up in the orange state, a neighbour who used to spit at him when he walked past and asked him if he had blessed himself with the pope’s piss that morning. His experiences of the conflict are actually reconstructed fairly well, including when women broke the British Army curfew and allowed IRA fighters to escape the area by putting arms in prams, an attempted assassination attempt, his regrets about Bloody Friday and the assassination of Jean McConville. It is after the resumption of struggle during the period of the hunger strikes that Hughes becomes increasingly disenchanted with the direction of the organisation under Adams and its becoming ‘just another middle-class party’.</p>
<p>The hunger strikes, especially the second, looms largest in documentaries about the troubles, for the obvious reason that it attracted extensive amounts of international attention. It is also identified as a turning point in Sinn Féin’s electoral struggle, based on the military stalemate the army had entered into in the eighties and the boost in electoral success. One hunger striker in particular argues that Adams stalled negotiations with the British in order to recoup further electoral success, Moloney’s A Secret History of the IRA (2002), though Adams-centric to a fault, offers the most fully-fleshed out account of provos’ history with Adams as the Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Hughes would not be the only longtime Republican to make criticisms such as these, in Maria McGlinchey’s Unfinished Business (2019), Christy Burke outlines his reasons for leaving Sinn Féin in 2009 after becoming frustrated by the degree to which the party’s strategy seemed to be determined by media strategists and consultants rather than his working class constituents. Hughes also outlines his suspicions that there was a high-level informer operating within the IRA after the execution of Joe Fenton had occurred before he could be interrogated, as if to protect this informerand how the UVF escalated their campaign, particularly in the most Republican areas of East Tyrone where dissent to the direction of a peace process could be anticipated, in order to strong-arm the republican movement into the peace process to make, as Bernadette says, ‘the price of staying out of it too high’. The relatively comfortable careers of the two loyalist men in Stormont form a sad contrast with that of Hughes, whose wishes that SF and Adams would have nothing to do with his funeral were ignored.</p>
<p>Shoot to Kill (1990) is a docu-drama about the 1984 – 86 inquiry conducted by the Manchester police Constable John Stalker and the events leading up to its being established in Armagh. In his attempts to identify whether or not the RUC had indeed colluded in the covering up of evidence relating to the shooting dead of six suspects, Stalker found himself stonewalled by the RUC and conspired against by MI5, who had him suspended from the Manchester police force under false pretences. In addition to being one of the best thrillers you’ll ever see, especially if you are into the representation of procedural detail, it is strikingly clear-eyed about just how partisan the RUC were. On YouTube the 3.5 hour film is followed by a thirty-minute panel discussion between the film’s director, Peter Kosminsky (who distaste for fictionalised narrative is deeply refreshing) David Trimble, Seamus Mallon and Ian Gow, a Tory MP who was assassinated by the IRA a few months after the discussion was broadcast. Trimble and Gow argue the RUC probably don’t do enough of what they are accused of in the film, Mallon that the RUC is a good police force but there are a couple of bad apples while Kosminsky speaks on the facts of how the RUC operate and O’Leary keeps interrupting him.</p>
<p>Mother Ireland (1991) is a documentary featuring interviews with Bernadette Devlin, Nell McCafferty as well as scholars, academics and filmmakers about Irish women and Irish feminism. Provisional IRA member Mairéad Farrell also appears with her voice dubbed over in order to satisfy laws on censorship in an appearance filmed a few months before she was  murdered by British intelligence agents in Gibraltar. It offers an expansive history of women under colonialism, the penal laws and outlines the radicalising influence of women in organisations such as the land leagues, Cumann na mBan, the broader Republican movement and the counter-revolution against women and women’s rights waged in the free state. The consensus offered here is that Republicanism is perfectly compatible with feminism as against the growing academic consensus that it has for most of its history been a manifestly anti-feminist or masculinist ‘discourse’ to the extent that it is indistinguishable from British imperialism. On the contradictions between feminism and republicanism, Nell McCafferty argues the following:</p>
<p>The further away the women are who are struggling the easier it is to support them. Irish women for example have no trouble supporting Willie Mandela and the ANC, or the guerrilla women in the Philippines or the women of Nicaragua but when it comes to the achievement of supporting physical force to achieve an objective here at home they are confused and I don’t expect Irish women or feminists…to be any less ambivalent or any clearer-mined than the majority of Irish constitutional nationalists who also don’t know, can’t make up their minds.</p>
<p>Sighle Humphries, veteran of Cumann na mBan in complains about scholars and journalists reading women republicans as mere handmaidens of the volunteers who should have followed the example of the English suffragettes. How the image of Irish womanhood is now used in order to attract multi-national investment and tourists is also very interestingly discussed.</p>
<p>In 1993, Olivia O’Leary presents an investigation into the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings, an instance in which two bombs were detonated on the north side of the inner city and one around Trinity College. In addition to forensic reconstructions of the routes the cars took across the border and towards Dublin, the report features extensive accounts of confidentially disclosed statements which make clear that the guards were unable to proceed with their investigation past a certain point or to pursue the loyalist terrorists from Portadown who were responsible. Eight perpetrators, all members of the mid-Ulster brigade of the UVF are apparently known to the guards. In the early stages of the investigation the RUC facilitated their investigation, but blocked their capacity to interview the suspects. The documentary also presents evidence which suggests the loyalist brigades were receiving money as informants from British intelligence and also received assistance from the Brits in order to do carry out the bombing.</p>
<p>In 1994 Adams appeared on the Late Late show. The first ten minutes of the interview consists of Gay interviewing Adams by himself and thereafter the playwright Hugh Leonard, Austin Currie (SDLP) Dermot Aherne (Fianna Fáil), Jim Kenny (Labour), Michael MacDowell (Progressive Democrats) show up to heckle him. There is no real substantive engagement with any issues surrounding the conflict in the north or the political approach of the Provisional IRA in this interview, but for anyone who has ever gotten frustrated with the standard of coverage Sinn Féin receive today (Louise O’Reilly being asked about whether a shadowy council in Belfast drafted her COVID policy or suchlike), it will be very familiar. Adams runs rings around them and pulls down applause breaks after almost everything he says in response because he has spent more or less his adult life talking working-class revolutionaries around to giving up every principle they ever abided by as opposed to the private schoolboy L&amp;H society debate clubs the rest of them were spawned in. All of them are only interested in the north insofar as it provides atrocities which may be used against people they don’t like and MacDowell goes so far at one stage to let slip that he thinks the RUC are a legitimate police force. The biggest laugh of all is that what they’re trying to bash Adams for, not facilitating a peace process, is that that is exactly what he’s there to promote. The question arises as to what these people really want? Hard to shake the feeling that it’s for people in Tyrone to stop making claims on being Irish.</p>
<p>Battle of the Bogside (2004) is another instance in which some aspects of the struggle have come to be re-read in new light. Events surrounding Free Derry become an Irish answer to generalised 68’r ructions with people who went on to have careers in journalism or Stormont commanding the bulk of the talking head space as opposed to republicans. Security forces and orange order members are surprisingly forthcoming in their contrition and their awareness about how what they did was wrong and that the violence against the protestors was unwarranted. Jack Lynch is criticised far more often than the actual people with the batons or parliamentary seats. No-one mentions imperialism and radical politics in general don’t get much of a look-in, unless throwing things at the police counts.</p>
<p>As the constitutional path and parliamentary wrangling begin to predominate and the struggle reaches a lower ebb in the course of the peace process it is through news footage of protests surrounding orange order marches and debates over the passing of another agreed deadline, news panel debates what constitutes an adequate form of de-commissioning that events such as these are recorded. These broadcasts are primarily interesting from the position the UUP are thrown back onto as upstart DUP’rs can just say insane nonsense and make Trimble sound like a provo by comparison.</p>
<p>In this context, obtaining justice then becomes an issue pursued through the courts, NGO’s, activism, appeals, international orgnisations. Some examples of what this looks like in practice include Eamon McCann’s lecture to the British Socialist Worker’s Party on the families of the Bloody Sunday victims securing an apology from David Cameron. Serious examinations of politics receive less and less treatment as time goes on here, the default Republican outlooks seen in RTÉ programming in the sixties have disappeared almost completely. To what can this be attributed? In his book, The Impact of the Troubles on the Republic of Ireland (2018), Brian Hanley outlines the effects of partition on the political outlook of the population in Ireland. Crucially though, Hanley does not do so in psychologistic or metaphorical terms. According to his account, this pivot in terms of how the twenty-six counties began to move away from a Republican orientation took place during the Fine Gael Labour coalition headed by William Cosgrave, a time characterised by the introduction of censorship and purging of the state broadcaster, heavy-handed police tactics which extracted false confessions under torture, conducted widepread surveillance of perceived ‘dissidents’ all with the aim of securing Ireland’s political and economic integration into the EEC. The Irish-language documentary Faoi Lámha an Stáit offers one of the better overviews of the period. In some ways Hanley’s account is made possible by the development of mass-media in the seventies, how this same manoeuvre was by Cumann na nGaedhal in a pre-television era would make for an interesting comparison and draw our attention to a far greater extent to state reprisal as a means of enforcing consent.</p>
<p>Aside from political concerns, the quality of the documentaries produced from roughly the year 2000 onwards begins to decline significantly. While gossipy documentaries produced about Brian Cowen or Bertie Ahern being Taoisigh will always be sort of hilarious because the squalid production values form something of a commentary on the era in which Fianna Fáil were at their political height, documentaries produced by BBC, RTÉ and Channel 4 on the north are next to useless, ceding ground to an Alliance party version of history wherein The Troubles was an exclusively tribal or sectarian conflict. Some more recent ones are just absolutely unwatchable trash, with hours of bizarrely over expressive presenters interviewing journalists and American academics rather than working-class people who lived at the forefront of the conflict, long takes where they speak into camera while walking down a busy high street with a set of mannerisms indistinguishable from Alan Patridge (‘But just what were the Troubles? I went to talk to Professor McElwee in Queen’s University Belfast, to find out the truth, behind the myth’).</p>
<p>The only ones worth watching now are independent productions, whether these are from commemorative DVDs produced by Sinn Féin or interviews conducted with veterans of the Border campaign. All of these are extremely valuable as historical documents, the insights offered by Jim Lane, Richard Behal and Liam Sutcliffe among others challenge many perceptions of the IRA’s ambivalent relationship with socialist politics which have been emerging amidst SF’s electoral revival. While SF’s ventures take the point of view of individuals mourning rather than broader political questions, broader questions into which dissident factions of the republican movement would have some scope in inserting themselves, they are at least, informative or interesting. Bernadette McAliskey’s lecture on the peace-process dispensation, ‘A Terrible State of Chassis‘, which suggests that the war was not worth fighting given the lack of improvement in the lot of the working class is worth watching, and worth contrasting also with another one she delivers to a Solidarity Group in Sweden at a point when the future of the peace process was evidently less secure. The Siege of Short Strand (2002) is one put together from edits of home footage filming events as they took place in one of the most Catholic areas in east Belfast. It points to some of the contradictions with the peace process dispensation, where pogroms are still eminently conceivable and police reticence to confront loyalist violence is clear. If anything interesting is to take place in breaking the Stormont deadlock in the north, it is fairly obvious that here are some of the primary tension points.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(Political reading of an episode late into James Joyce&rsquo;s novel Ulysses. It&rsquo;s very academic, I wrote it intending it to form part of the doctoral thesis, but it did not make the final cut.)</em></p>
<p>‘Eumaeus’ is Ulysses‘ (1922) third last episode and is written in a style manifestly distinct from the rest of the novel. This is due to its functioning, I contend, as a parody of nineteenth century realism, of which someone like Charles Dickens might be said to be a standard-bearer, an author whose works Eumaeus both references and satirises. This would not in itself render Eumaeus an episode all that distinct from the rest of the novel; by the time we’re in the novel’s second half the stylistic ‘norm’ established in the Telemachiad has been left behind, in favour of a style which more often than not parodies more traditional or popular literary forms. However, Eumaeus is distinct among these for its representation of the state, society and Dublin at the turn of the century from a more overtly political perspective and this post aims to flesh out some of these issues to a greater extent.</p>
<p>Tony Farmar and Terry Eagleton identify the Famine and subsequent acts of land reform imposed by the British parliament as Ireland’s answer to the bourgeois revolutions of England and France, historical moments which loom so large within the history of dialectical materialism. These legislative reforms, so the argument goes, further codified in law what the land seizures and clearances which came in the wake of Famine had brought about; the emergence of Ireland as an economy of large-scale pastoral production, requiring the construction of one of the world’s densest railway systems in order to facilitate extraction and distribution of its exports.</p>
<p>David Convery argues that the predominantly rural nature of the Irish economy is often posited as a means of questioning the existence of an Irish class system in any form. This proposition has some unfortunate correspondences to the representation of the working class in Ulysses, a novel more broadly typified by representations of Dublin’s indigenous service industry and petit-bourgeoisie; representations of the working class in Ulysses function primarily as a means of providing local detail (7.21 – 24) or a threatening atmosphere (16.327 – 330). This is despite the extent of the poverty which would have been visible in Dublin at the time in which Ulysses is set in 1904; Conor McCabe notes that Dublin had the highest mortality rate in the British empire around the turn of the century and in a 1937 review of the novel Alick West criticised Ulysses on the basis of this oversight: ‘Joyce shows…little of the relations of production. There are no disputes between employers and labour, no struggle for wages, no strikes’.</p>
<p>Ulysses does manifest a significantly greater degree of attention to the domestic consumption of advertising canvassers, clerks and journalists who are all present in the novel to a significantly greater extent than labourers, industrial workers or peasant farmers despite the fact that clerks and more commercial workers were resident in the city’s suburbs to avoid paying the city rates; the labouring population formed almost half the working population and were concentrated in the inner city. It is worth noting, as Farmar does, that Dublin’s high street stores were, at the time in which Ulysses is set, beginning to stock goods promoting the lifestyle choices of a growing middle class, who were also beginning to enjoy the benefits of a more widespread selection of imports such as stout, biscuits, clothes, sugar and tea. However, this disproportionate amount of attention to the end-point of the productive process, passing over production itself or the labourers on whom these global supply chains depended, is indicative of the novel’s blindness to class antagonisms which were soon to lead to crises such as the first world war, the 1913 Lockout and the 1916 Rising. Ulysses might therefore be described as a case study of what György Lukács referred to as a modernist naturalism incapable of dealing with capitalist society as a broader totality. To provide further context to the relative conservatism of Irish modernism, we might add Joe Cleary’s reference to the dissolution of Irish popular culture after the Famine and the relative lack of a mass print culture, two extenuating factors which might plausibly have stymied the development of a more robust and indigenous literary tradition more overtly engaged in social critique.</p>
<p>What is crucial to recall in this is that by the end of the nineteenth century, Irish agriculture has taken on a global character. It was not an indigenous industry in any sense, but one that had been developed for export, and Ireland’s location within the British empire made Ireland effectively dependent on Britain as an export market which allowed for no protectionist tariffs. The overwhelming majority of these exports took the form of alcohol and live cattle, the latter being transported from big farms in the island’s midlands, to the Dublin docks, to slaughterhouses in the north of England where demand for Irish produce remained constant in order to meet the demands of the growing centres of manufacturing. This relationship between England and Ireland functioned extremely well in delivering capital surpluses to those who owned large farms in Ireland as well as industrialists and landed farmers in England, Irish small farmers being left as poorly off as they were in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
<p>To provide an example of the ways in which Eumaeus ultimately shies away from the provision of an accurate picture of the working class in Dublin in 1904, we might consider the episode’s beginning, when the smell emitted from a bakery is described, and the narrative voice interleaves Stephen and Bloom’s subjective responses, in modes such as Shakespearean malapropism, folk wisdom, Catholic ritualising and advertising jingles, all of which will be familiar from earlier parts of the text (16.51 – 59). In contrast to the rich symbolic terrain of the bakery, as well the comparatively vibrant account of the grocers, clothiers and North Star Hotel, the warehouses on Beresford place, junctures at which Dublin’s key position within the supply chain outlined above, are primarily defined by their inanition and emptiness. The more commonsensical explanation that it is a time in which warehouse labour would presumably not be taking place should not be discounted, especially given that night work in bakeries was at the time a point of struggle within labour disputes, but the fact that the bakery is operational while the warehouses are not is nevertheless symptomatic of Eumaeus’ political interventions. These warehouses, and the docking infrastructure within which they were a part, formed one of the most important sites of struggle during the labour disputes of 1913; when Dublin’s employers began to import scab labour from England at the end of October as a means of breaking the strike, the workers succeeded in closing the docks. This attenuation of Eumaeus’ scope to Dublin’s domestic economy at the expense of an account of Ireland’s economic position relative to an imperial power, let alone a world capitalist totality, is of a part with the compression or rationalisation of the episode’s style which hails the reader in the anonymised voice of a contrived ‘common man’. Republicanism, trade unionism, socialism and anarchism are all touched upon in this episode, albeit while maintaining the fundamental scepticism regarding totalising approaches that one sees elsewhere in Ulysses, such as those that we might find in these schools of thought and praxis. Eumaeus instead gestures towards some aspects of these anti-statist formations against which Bloom’s liberal reformism contrasts.</p>
<p>Due to the experiential ways in which Joyce represents the interiority of his characters and erects totalising propositions only as a prelude to their deconstruction, it can be difficult to obtain a precise notion of Bloom’s politics. Nevertheless, there is a constellation of perspectives outlined by Bloom, via Stephen and Eumaeus’ narrative voice, with a direct bearing on the style in which Eumaeus is written. At the beginning of this episode, Bloom inveighs Stephen with a series of monologues, mediated via the narrative voice, regarding the danger Stephen faces in continuing to spend his time in disreputable areas such as Monto, attempting to encourage him to live his life in a more respectable way. As the episode continues, Bloom considers the ways in which Stephen might utilise the talents he presumably possesses in singing and literature in order to manoeuvre himself into some of the more fashionable upper class salons in Dublin (16.1828 – 1860). Throughout Eumaeus therefore, the theme of working one’s way into a higher class or potentially descend into a lower one predominates.</p>
<p>The urban proletariat is increasingly visible in Eumaeus in the guise of three characters who are provided with something approximating an extensive treatment. The first of these is John Corley, a character immediately ironised by being referred to as Lord John Corley. It becomes clear that this is a sardonic reference to a genealogy which links him both with the Talbot family of Malahide as well as Jesus Christ (16.128 – 140). These genealogies not only parody Dickens’ representations of the poor as temporarily embarrassed aristocrats, but represent Corley as an unreliable witness, as when Corley’s account of his unemployment and general lack of funds is glossed by the narrative voice as a ‘doleful ditty’ (16.144), as though Corley were playing up his hard luck solely in order to extract sympathy and money from Stephen. Corley’s vector over the course of the previous day, and indeed number of years, forms an intriguing parallel with that of Stephen. Corley firstly seems to have had some kind of a drunken falling out with Lenehan, just as Stephen has with Mulligan. Stephen is coming from Clifton School in Dalkey just as Corley may be heading there later in the day in order to request a job. Finally, they both spent time in the Christian Brothers. This would not have been unusual for Catholic men in Ireland at the time, but the emphasised difference between Corley’s experience of the school system when compared to Stephen’s is nonetheless illustrative. Based on how closely their experiences of the previous day correspond and their educational experiences diverge, the episode suggests how easy it would be for Stephen to be in the position of needing to beg from people in the near future, given that neither of them at this particular point have a job or a home to go to. When Bloom and Stephen enter the cabman’s shelter, Stephen is reflecting on a memory of the front room in his former home, presumably as a result of some residual anxiety at seeing the state in which Corley is in (16.270 – 275). All these discourses surrounding Corley’s character, as well Bloom’s disinterested reflection on class relations being the product of disproportionately distributed amounts of luck (16.240) or a failure on the behalf of the underprivileged to maximise their own individual capacities, suggest that Corley, like Stephen, is in his current situation due to poor judgement and a lack of initiative. This is emphasised further when Bloom reflects on Corley, as ‘the other parasite’ (16.231), a formulation which would presumably render Stephen the first.</p>
<p>The next representative of the working class in Eumaeus comes in the figure of the sex worker who Bloom sees passing by the cabman’s shelter. References are made to the Lock hospital, an institution associated with the treatment of venereal disease. Bloom’s attitude towards the woman, and the voice of the episode with which Bloom’s perspective is suffused, seems at first to be slightly more liberal than one would expect. At the time, the predominating notion of a prostitute amounted to that of a sinful, fallen woman and little consideration would have been given to the material conditions which might lead to people becoming sex workers. In much nineteenth century medical literature for instance, prostitutes were considered a source of contamination, corruption and disease. The Italian criminologist Cesara Lombroso and French physician Louis Fiaux, studied working class women in the late nineteenth century via phrenological methods, arguing that prostitutes had distorted body parts, primitive and childlike attention spans and limited cognitive capacities. The reactionary tendencies at play in Eumaeus’ representation of sex workers return us to the matter of Ireland’s colonial dependency, there being a correlation between the location of military barracks and areas in which the selling of sex is more widespread than elsewhere, as it was for the famous wrens of the Curragh as well as Tipperary town where there the construction of a garrison led to the residents complaining of a marked increase in sex workers in 1877. The district of Monto has its origins here too; extra troops were garrisoned along Mecklenberg street in the early nineteenth century due to rising anxieties regarding a potential French invasion. The publication of an account written by James Greenwood on the wrens in 1867 in the Pall Mall Gazzette embarrassed the authorities into taking action and passing both the Curragh of Kildare and Contagious Diseases Acts in 1868, laws which permitted state authorities to intervene more directly in the camp and its residents. It is via Eumaeus’ representation of the sex worker then, that a biopolitical framework becomes more clearly foregrounded and the notion of becoming or being working class takes on a pathological valency in its association with venereal disease and the contemporary discourses composing the broader prostitute imaginary. We might recall here Corley being referred to as a parasite as well as the alcoholism of the man who may or may not be the town clerk Henry Campbel.</p>
<p>It is here that we come to a fulcrum of Bloom’s political beliefs, accounts of which often emphasise his liberal open-mindedness, tolerance and the rational nature of his proposals for the improvement of society. In many ways, these appraisals fail to interrogate these reforms’ dependence on the adjustment of individual behaviour or seeming belief in the capacity of a capitalist market to function according to moral tenets. Some of Bloom’s reflections on improving the lot of the working classes for instance, include the promotion of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association as a means of treating alcoholism and the use of community venues in order to stage educational plays or informative lectures (16.793 – 795). It is interesting to note that in comparison to some actually existing reform movements these policy proposals were not as progressive as they might seem; figures such as James Larkin were making practical efforts to construct a working-class counter-culture within the trade union movement based on collective values such as sharing and solidarity in opposition to a bourgeois individualism. Larkin’s plans depended on the development of spaces within which rank-and-file members of the Irish Transport and General Worker’s Union and their families could receive education, social welfare supports and participate in sporting activities. These efforts, which would have been roughly contemporaneous with the events of the novel, in fact contrast with Bloom’s far more conservative vision of social reform. The extent of Bloom’s social vision therefore amounts to the pithy injunction to more ‘do good and net a profit’ (16.800 – 801), which would locate Bloom’s plans for social improvement and welfare very much within the post-Fordist social contract, whereby increased amounts of private consumption, especially international travel, would be made possible by a substantial universal income (16.509 – 510; 16.1133 – 1135; 16.641 – 16.648). These concessions are then leveraged as a means of de-communalising social welfare programmes and public investment, replacing them with philanthropy or a moral economy. It is fitting then, that within much of Bloom’s narration he seems to regard himself as a corporate entity (16.537 – 538); he reflects throughout the episode on the potentially lucrative nature of the concert tours he might establish with both Stephen and Molly’s talents (16.522 – 526). This is not to suggest that Ulysses or Bloom provide an insight into the future of the Atlanticist economies but what the entrepreneurial logics of valuing thrift and propriety elsewhere praised in the discourse terminates in (16.539 – 562). Bloom’s understanding of the role of policing also casts doubt on the notion that he is representative of progressive politics; Bloom notes in the earlier in the episode that only more fashionable parts of Dublin can be depended upon as areas in which a strong police presence can be noted as opposed to more deprived areas such as Monto. This thought evinces a surprising degree of awareness regarding the political nature of policing and even some degree of cynicism regarding the ruling classes (160.80 – 82), but one should note that Bloom’s complaint originates in his thought that the police are not in Dublin’s red light district in sufficient numbers. This would be despite prostitutes being subject to the power of the state on a regular basis, as Maria Luddy argues  ‘authority in the form of police and prison officers governed their lives’. Of course, Bloom is more interested in ensuring Stephen can have safe traffic through more deprived areas than he is in the conditions in said areas. Shortly after Bloom thinks on this issue, Bloom and Stephen are hailed by a sentry man at Amiens Street who turns out to be a friend of Simon Dedalus. The man is named Gumley and towards the end of the episode, he is represented as being sufficiently free from work to do that he is asleep, suggesting not only that police forces are somewhat ineffectual or benign, but dismisses the idea also that they represent an exogenous, occupying or coercive force; their familiarity and essential harmlessness is confirmed by Gumley familiarity to the two men.</p>
<p>When the conversation in the cabman’s shelter turns to imperialist violence, Bloom sceptically reflects that Irish soldiers were just as prone to violent engagements such as this (16.1042) and that the English are quite restrained in their use of force (16.1033 – 1034). In addition to being contrary to Bloom’s personal experience, given that he was nearly run over by a mounted policeman at a protest against the Boer war, between these two propositions there is not only a form of both-sidesism at play, where both sides make use of violence and therefore both are equally bad, but ultimately, British soldiers are framed as making use of a restrained or judicious, ‘good’ violence in opposition to the violence committed by bad Irish soldiers, which is of course, contrary to his staunch doctrine of non-violence (16.1060). Booker identifies a both-sidesism associated with Bloom’s character and suggests that this may relate to his class interests; Bloom is shown to possess stocks in the Canadian government to a value of £900 to which a British victory in the Boer war would have provided greater security. Lawrence argues that Bloom’s politics are ambiguous in their orientation due to the half-admiration he seemingly expresses via the ambiguity of a key clause which suggests that Bloom has only been half-cured of his youthful radicalism and admiration for those who would use violence in the achievement of their political aims.</p>
<p>It is primarily anarchists, the labour movement and Republicans who are provided with the short end of the argumentative stick by having their positions represented as confused and inchoate throughout the episode, at the end of which Bloom’s liberal utopianism and Stephen’s aesthetic hermeticism appear comparatively engagé.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Perry Anderson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Origins of the Present Crisis&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>[Page references refer to the essay as it appears in <em>English Questions</em> Verso, 1992]</p>
<p><em>17 - 18</em> England experienced the first, most mediated and least pure bourgeois revolution of any major European country during the Civil War of 1640 - 9</p>
<p><em>20-1</em> England experienced the first industrial revolution in a period of counter-revolutionary war, producing the earliest proletariat when socialist theory was underdeveloped and an industrial bourgeoisie skewed towards the aristocracy.</p>
<p>Agrarian capitalism provided the economic and human surplus for industrailisation, depopulating the countryside to provide investment and labour for the towns.</p>
<p>Mercantile imperialism, the cotton industry dominating Asia, Africa and Latin America provided markets and raw materials.</p>
<p>This industrial capitalist class was based in the Manchester and the North but it skewed aristocratically, a bias consolidated in the aftermath of the French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p>It secured incorporation into the political system by forcing an extension of the franchise while excluding the proletariat in the Reform bill of 1832.</p>
<p>Its last victory, from Anderson&rsquo;s point of view was the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, in a bid to roll back cereal protection which rebounded to the benefit of landowners at its expense, limiting the markets for manufactures at home and abroad.</p>
<p><em>23</em> Anderson argues the English working class achieved no victories, provoking a massacre when it attempted to organise the first national political campaign of the post-war period in 1819.</p>
<p>In the late twenties and early thirties it produced in Owenism the first mass socialist movement of the century, which was crushed, followed by Chartism.</p>
<p>Anderson attributes this to its prematurity; at the high point of its insurgency a scientific theory of capitalism and socialism was unavailable.</p>
<p><em>25</em> By the end of the nineteenth century the British Empire had established the largest empire in history. British society fundamentally acclimatised to imperialism, with Conservatives, Liberals and Fabians all pro-imperial in outlook.</p>
<p>Anderson argues that the British working class benefitted only indirectly from differences in productivity between Britain and overseas and emigration was a more important safety-valve than imperial super-profits; the primary impact of Empire on the English working class was ideological</p>
<p>[cf. Smith on why this is wrong]</p>
<p><em>27</em> England emerged from two world wars undefeated, its social structure untouched by external shocks, unlike the European powers. European war actually defused a period of domestic political conflict.</p>
<p><em>30</em> The extent of ruling-class hegemony over the British proletariat is historically unprecedented.</p>
<p><em>32</em> The most significant ideology of the industrial bourgeoisie of the nineteenth century is utilitarianism; a militant creed of capital accumulation and cultural nihilism. It never achieved hegemonic status.</p>
<p>Anderson also mentions philanthropic liberalism.</p>
<p><em>E.P. Thompson&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Peculiarities of the English&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>[Page references refer to the essay as it appears in <em>The Poverty of Theory &amp; Other Essays</em> Merlin Press, 1978]</p>
<p><em>37 - 8</em> Anderson argues that Anderson is, in line with orthodox Marxism, uncritically adopting an ideal model of working class experience and social development inherited from the French revolution.</p>
<p>Some of the particularities of the English conjunctureL</p>
<p>i) the industrial bourgeoisie in England failed to reshape ruling institutions in its own image; the aristocracy remained a senior partner</p>
<p>ii) the bourgeoisie never developed a totalising worldview making do with empiricism
iii) a premature bourgeoisie produced a premature working class; without a totalising theory of its own it could not bring its struggles to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p><em>40</em> Thompson argues that Anderson is incorrect in regarding agrarian capitalists as feudal or semi-feudal rather than a capitalist class proper, which from Thompson&rsquo;s perspective, they very much were.</p>
<p><em>41</em> Capitalist development in the countryside, e.g. the production of wool for markets in London, pre-dates the point at which the revolution as a political process began to get underway by about a century and this is itself part of an even longer process which Thompson traces back to the twelfth century.</p>
<p><em>42</em> In short Anderson&rsquo;s account is simplistic, this rural agrarian class was not backward but pro-active in shaping institutions of state, such as the church and parliament.</p>
<p><em>44</em> Naturalistic political economy may have been an article of faith for the industrial bourgeoisie but as a doctrine laissez-faire begins with this agricultural capitalist class. This is where Adam Smith derives his doctrine from. They had significant amounts of experience in disciplining their labour force and were central to purging the countryside and its superstructure of regnant Christian notions of moral law, duty, paternality, etc.</p>
<p><em>47</em> Thompson argues against the notion of a classic model of social development at all and draws attention to more recent research which also interrogates the purity of the French Revolution as an authentic industrial bourgeois experience.</p>
<p><em>48</em> This terminates in a reduction of political phenomena to their mere class content and evacuates a lot of specificity, complexity.</p>
<p><em>53</em> Argues Anderson over-states the aristocratic character of the British capitalist class, both historically and in the present.</p>
<p><em>61 - 3</em> Makes the case for the English intellectual tradition on the basis of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s scientific discoveries and objects to the idea that empiricism is an ideology as opposed to a method.</p>
<p><em>Perry Anderson&rsquo;s Arguments within English Marxism</em></p>
<p><em>[Page references refer to the Verso 1980 edition]</em></p>
<p><em>[Anderson refers throughout to &lsquo;The Poverty of Theory&rsquo;, an essay Thompson wrote which critiques the philosophy of Louis Althusser. It&rsquo;s a great essay but his critique is, in essence, analogous his critique of Anderson and in many ways is a proxy attack on Anderson and the NLR so I don&rsquo;t provide any notes taken from it here]</em></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: Historiography</strong></p>
<p><em>7</em> Anderson begins by conceding that Thompson was right about Althusser&rsquo;s epistemology being circular, that his historical work was useless, that scientific theories can define and produce their own legitimacy by themselves regardless of facts or evidence.</p>
<p><em>8 - 11</em> Anderson charges Thompson with a lack of interest in Marxian historiography and theories of history, which is inadequate as:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;far from being especially laible to a schedule of unduly static concepts, as Thompson contends, Marxism preeminently possesses concepts that both theorise and the possibilities and limits of historical change as such (contradiction), and explore the dynamic of particular processes of development themselves&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em>12</em> In rejecting a science of history in favour of the provisionality, selectivity and falsifiability of historical research Thompson misunderstood scientific inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Agency</strong></p>
<p><em>18</em> Thompson&rsquo;s dependence on the notions of agency and experience are simplistic; the terms move between autonomous prime mover or mere instrument.</p>
<p><em>25</em> In doing so Thompson disarms himself to understanding determined social phenomena; events in which agency does not arise.</p>
<p><em>37 - 45</em> Thompson under-states the extent to which the British working class had been captured by a spirit of counter-revolutionary nationalism, docile reformism and economism.</p>
<p><em>46</em> He also overstates Owen&rsquo;s influence, insisting that though sections of the English working class may have been revolutionary they were not socialists - rather Republicans or constitutionalist reformists - and by the time socialism did become a broadly accepted doctrine the revolutionary moment had passed.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Marxism</strong></p>
<p><em>60</em> By his own admission Thompson prefers the early Marx of <em>The German Ideology</em>, <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> and the Paris Manuscripts, regarding him as having been hypnotised by the static, ahistorical and unproductively law-bound categories of political economy in <em>Capital</em>.</p>
<p><em>68</em> This led him to focus on abstract models of modes of production rather than historical actuality, which is where the Althusserian tradition derives from.</p>
<p><em>69 - 71</em> Anderson makes the point that Althusser and those who have taken up his work since have conducted work in economics, politics, culture, the state etc., and also makes the point that Althusser&rsquo;s account of bourgeois law aligns very closely with Thompson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><em>73 - 5</em> Anderson completely repudiates Thompson&rsquo;s condemnation of Althusser&rsquo;s division of society into separate strata on the basis that it violates the irreducibility of human experience: historical temporality obviously varies by place, time, social development and says Thompson is on much firmer ground when he accuses Althusser failed to synthesise these moments after he had divided them up.</p>
<p><em>78</em> Provides Raymond Williams&rsquo; concept of over-determination as &lsquo;setting of limits&rsquo; or &rsquo;exerting of pressures&rsquo; as the best use of the term, over Thompson&rsquo;s caricature of &lsquo;control&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Stalinism</strong></p>
<p>*100 - 1 * Anderson challenges Thompson&rsquo;s account of the history of Marxist thought, which Thompson critiques as ideologically given over, at varying stages throughout the twentieth century to notions of evolutionism, voluntarism and structuralism, making the point that Thompson is lumping together a lot of traditions and thinkers which were at odds with each other.</p>
<p><em>108</em> And also goes after those Marxists Thompson praises as useless rightist pseuds.</p>

<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Production, Consumption, Distribution, Exchange (Circulation)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>(1) Production</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Independent Individuals, Eighteenth-century Ideas</em></p>
<p><em>83</em> Begins with a dismissal of the accounts of political economy provided by bourgeois economists who imagine political economy as functioning in the same way as it is represented in Daniel Defoe&rsquo;s novel <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, as though its basis is the autonomy of the individual.</p>
<p><em>84</em> Looking at history the fact that the individual belongs to a far larger social totality is obvious; it is only in the eighteenth century, when production and social relations reach an advanced stage that civil society arises and individuals begin to confront sociality as a means to their own end.</p>
<p><em>85</em> Considering production therefore requires us to investigate its historical forms; each epoch does have characteristics in common, but production in general is an abstraction it is conducted by social individuals.</p>
<p><em>86</em> Production is therefore not confined to a specific sector of production, it is a broader social occurrence, it forms a totality.</p>
<p>This broader social metabolism within which production occurs is ignored by political economists such as John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith.</p>
<p><em>87</em> This means their works digress into tautology; claiming that certain races, locations, climates or natural conditions are more advantageous to production than others amounts to nothing more than asserting that wealth is more easily created where it exists to a greater extent.</p>
<p>The aim of bourgeois economists is to present production as though it abides by eternal and natural laws which act independently of history, allowing them to smuggle bourgeois ideology into the picture, under the guise of scientific analysis.</p>
<p>Definition: production is the appropriation of nature on the part of an individual within and though a specific form of society.</p>
<p>In this sense it is a tautology to say that property is a precondition of production. The conceptual leap here is that private property or bourgeois law is a pre-condition.</p>
<p><em>88</em> Historically it is common property that is the more common form, in ancient or tribal societies.</p>
<p>In production members of society shape the products of nature in accordance with human needs.</p>
<p><em>89</em> Production creates the objects, distribution divides them according to social laws, exchange parcels out the divided shares according to individual needs, in consumption the object&rsquo;s presence in a social movement ends and becomes a direct object and servant of individual need.</p>
<p>Production is the point of departure, distribution and exchange the middle and consumption the conclusion.</p>
<p>Distribution and exchange are themselves twofold since distribution is determined by society and exchange is conducted by individuals.</p>
<p>The person objectifies himself in production, the thing subjectifies itself in the person. In distribution society mediates between production and consumption in the form of general, dominant determinants and in exchange the two are mediated by the chance characteristics of the individual.</p>
<p>Production is the generality, distribution and exchange the particularity and consumption the singularity in which the whole is integrated.</p>
<p><em>90</em> Production is also consumption. The individual not only develops his abilities in production but also expends them, uses them up in the act of production, just as natural procreation is the consumption of life forces.</p>
<p>The means of production and raw materials are consumed in their use and dissolved into their elements again; this is productive consumption.</p>
<p><em>91</em> They are the same, but at the same time a mediating movement takes place between the two. Without production consumption would lack an object.</p>
<p><em>Distribution and Production</em></p>
<p><em>95</em> Bourgeois economists separate production from distribution; ground rent, wages, interest and profit are seen as belonging solely to distribution while land, labour and capital appear as agents of production.</p>
<p>As such they are posited multiple times; as agent of production, as source of income and determinant of specific forms of distribution</p>
<p>Interest and profit are also figured as agents of production in the sense that they are forms in which capital increases. Interest and profit as forms of distribution presuppose capital as an agent of production.</p>
<p>Similarly, distribution appears merely as the obverse of the agents of production whereas distribution is itself a product of production.</p>
<p><em>97 - 8</em> Deals with various historic phases through which production has proceeded, the point of which is that production is not new, nor it is wedded to industrial production, the mode of pillage for example is determined by the regnant forms of production.</p>
<p>Circulation is a specific moment of exchange, and it is also exchange in its totality.</p>
<p><em>99</em> Exchange appears independent of and indifferent to production only in the final phase where product is exchanged for consumption.</p>
<p>But there is no exchange without division of labour; private exchange presupposes private production. The intensity and speed of exchange, its velocity, are determined by the development and structure of production.</p>
<p>These are not identical, but they all form members of a totality, they are distinctions within an overarching unity.</p>
<p>Production predominates, not only over itself, in the antithetical definition of production, but over other moments as well; the process always returns to production to begin anew.</p>
<p><em><strong>(3) The Method of Political Economy</strong></em></p>
<p><em>100</em> Economists in the seventeenth century always initiated their studies by living wholes; population, nation states, groups of states, and conclude by their analysis with a series of abstractions, general relations such as divisions of labour, money, value, etc.</p>
<p>As soon as these individual moments had been firmly established and abstracted economic systems developed, which ascended from the simple relations.</p>
<p><em>101</em> These were labour, division of labour, exchange value, to the level of the state and exchange between nations.</p>
<p>The concrete is the concrete because it is the coming together of many determinations, it is unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking as a result, not as a point of departure.</p>
<p>The incorrect method would be to begin with the abstractions. This was Hegel&rsquo;s mistake, conceiving the real as a product of thought conceiving itself.</p>
<p><em>102 - 5</em> Considers the role of categories such as possession, labour and money in their historical context to demonstrate that their validity consist only for and within these relations.</p>
<p>Bourgeois society is the most developed and complex historic organisation of production and it therefore allows insights into preceding social formations, but bourgeois economists only view their object of consideration from one point of view.</p>
<p><em>107</em> Under the feudal mode of production capital possesses a landed-proprietary character, with the exception of artisanal or handicraft production in the cities. In bourgeois society the opposite happens and agriculture becomes increasingly a branch of industry.</p>
<p><em>110 - 111</em> Insanely good series of riffs on culture and production; cf. Hegel&rsquo;s aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong>The Chapter on Money</strong></p>
<p><em>115</em> Series of critical notes taken on Alfred Darimon&rsquo;s <em>On The Reform of Banks</em> (1856)</p>
<p>Criticises Darimon for misunderstanding the amount of bills in circulation as identical with the requirements of circulation, arguing that the quantity of discountered bills and its fluctuations express the requirements of credit.</p>
<p><em>116</em> Attributes this mistake to his being a Proudhonist; the data he presents with one column indicating the amount of gold in a bank and the amount of bills issued by that bank only indicate that a banks portfolio filled up with bills of exchange and its vaults emptied oof metal in proportion as bills of exchange were presented to it for the purpose of withdring metal.</p>
<p><em>117 - 8</em> The real finding is that the metal assets of the bank and the securities are out of proportion with one another and that different observations; one increasing while the other decreases and vice versa, requires different explanations.</p>
<p><em>119</em> In 1855 the Bank of France saw its gold diminish by 44 million and its portfolio increase by 101 million. It therefore adopted a set of measures to defend its vaults against its portfolio by reducing the time of payment of bills presented for discount from 90 to 75; in doing so it raised the terms on which its metals were available to commerce; Darimon misreads this as the bank withdrawing its trade in gold and silver at the time when the public needs it.</p>
<p><em>120 - 1</em> Marx accuses Darimon of not understanding the economic laws which govern what the banks actually do and why they do it; what happened was an outcome of a broader balance of payments crisis which related to broader occurrences in the economy; it had nothing to do with the banks acting autonomously against the public interest.</p>
<p><em>122</em> Darimon&rsquo;s erroneous conclusions arise from the Proudhonist focus on methods of distribution rather than the broader productive apparatus of which it is a part.</p>
<p><em>123</em> Scarcity of circulation is both an effect and cause of the accumulation of capital more broadly; expecting that money, whether it supposedly claims to represent labour or not, can perform their function without suspending the function of money is contradictory; wage labour is at the core of this antagonism.</p>
<p>Great line: <em>&lsquo;The notion of crédit gratuit, incidentally, is only a hypocritical, philistine and anxiety-ridden form of the saying: property is theft. Instead of the workers</em> taking <em>the capitalists&rsquo; capital, the capitalists are supposed to be comeplled to</em> give <em>it to them&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>124 - 6</em> Darimon believes that the mere form of currency, gold and silver, are at the root of the problem; if all commodities could be made instruments of exchange on an equal footing periodic commercial crises could be averted: <em>&lsquo;Let the pope remain, but make everybody pope&rsquo;</em>.</p>
<p><em>127</em> The capitalist mode of production requires a means of exchange that can serve as a repository and representation of value. Some of these instruments of exchange may be more or less convenient than others, but it is still required in its essential form or function.</p>
<p><em>128 - 9</em> A drain in precious metals from the banks may be caused by a food shortage such as the failure of the grain crop; this would require increased purchases of foreign grain from overseas. This drain would be caused by a shortage of grain however, and not by the drain of precious metals, although this may aggravate it.</p>
<p>It is not the case, as Proudhon claims, that gold and silver are the only authentic repository of value in contrast to other commodities. This can be seen in the outlined example, the rise in grain prices means that more gold and silver has to be spent on grain imports; the price of gold and silver has obviously declined relative to grain here, no privilege insulates them.</p>
<p><em>130</em> This is not a one-to-one relationship, the depreciation of all other commodities relative to grain is greater than the relative rise in grain prices, although there are also instances in which the depreciation does not occur; Marx notes industrial goods as an exception of recent years.</p>
<p>The export of gold cannot be blamed for the crisis; this reduces it to one of supply and demand, which is only relevant within the sphere of primary need.</p>
<p>The roles of gold and silver in economic crisis take place in two ways:</p>
<p>i) when the export of gold is made more difficult due to the restrictions visited upon the banks viz. the export of gold impact disadvantageously on national circulation
ii) when the export of gold is necessary because foreign nations will not accept anything else</p>
<p><em>131</em> As soon as a note representing five pounds of gold is no longer convertible into gold a contradiction between the price of a note and the price of gold asserts itself. The point in dispute among economists is not the convertibility itself but how it is to be enforced; either by law or by the bank.</p>
<p><em>132</em> Convertibility into gold and silver is the practical measure of a currency, nominal value is an abstract relationship, convertibility demonstrates is the test.</p>
<p><em>133</em> Paper money is preferred in Scotland which is why it never followed England into monetary crisis despite it following England into every other type of economic crisis.</p>
<p><em>134</em> Darimon and his followers mistake the fact that gold is in certain jurisdiction the value repository of last resort for its being an authentic store of value; they miss gold&rsquo;s depreciation relative to other commodities.</p>
<p>The real answer to the contradiction is to abolish prices by doing away with exchange value, which is a fundamental component of the bourgeois mode of production; whether money is apportioned out on the basis of the exertion of labour hours or not.</p>
<p><em>135</em> The fact that it is convertible will result in a situation where it appreciates or depreciates relative to other commodities; it is not the amount of labour time that determines value but the amount of necessary labour time; a time-chit representing hours of labour would only remain stable if productivity was constant, but in reality, it is always subject to change.</p>
<p><em>137</em> The value of all comodities is determined by the labour time required to produce them. Their price is this exchange value expressed in money.</p>
<p>Proudhon&rsquo;s proposals seek to equate price and value but the value of commodities expressed by labour time is thier average value, which is an external abstraction calculated out as the average price of an epoch.</p>
<p>It is still the driving force of commodity markets and the dynamic undergirding oscillations in price and value in exchange despite it being abstract and neither is its actuality irrelevant; it determines speculation on mercantile markets mercantile speculation because the market value is always different, is always above or below this average value of a commodity</p>
<p>Market value equates itself with real value by means of constant oscillations never by means of an equation with real value but by means of non-equation of itself; the two never balance out, or only do so incidentally but value is nevertheless the law the former runs through.</p>
<p><em>138</em> Supply and demand determine the price of a commodity, they never balance, or only do so coincidentally; but the cost of production determines the oscillations of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Proudhonists imagine they are abolishing the contradiction between value and price by expressing value in units of labour time.</p>
<p><em>139</em> It simply would not function as a convertible currency as the depreciation of commodities arises out of the law of the rising productivity of labour time.</p>
<p><em>140</em> Because price is not equal to value, labour time cannot be the element in which prices are expressed; in that case labour time would have to express itself simultaneously as the determining and the non-determining element; labour-time exists only as an ideal it cannot serve as a means of price comparisons.</p>
<p><em>141</em> All commodities are qualitatively equal and quantitatively distinct, hence they can be measured against each other and substituted for one another in certain quantitative relations.</p>
<p>Value is what renders them commensurate.</p>
<p><em>142</em> Their exchange value expresses the extent of its exchangeability; money is the store of value in which all commodities can equate, compare and measure themselves. This is expressed via comparison, e.g. 1 unit of cheese = 2 blocks of wood</p>
<p>This process abstracts from the commodities concrete, real aspects; this is a contradiction.</p>
<p><em>143</em> This exchange value also expresses the amount of labour power congealed in the commodity.</p>
<p><em>144</em> Though it is straightforward to express commodities in terms of each other ideally, exchange itself is a real process and has to proceed through a determinate set of stages; it requires a third term, in the form of money, the symbol of the commodity as a commodity, the commodity&rsquo;s exchange value itself which represents labour time as such.</p>
<p>This is a social symbol, it expresses nothing more than a social relation.</p>
<p><em>146</em> Money is i) a measure of commodity exchange ii) a medium of exchange iii) a representative of commodities iv) a general commodity alongside particular commodities.</p>
<p>By being a general commodity in relation to all others, it becomes the realised and realisable form of capital; the form of calpital whic is always valid.</p>
<p>As productive relations develop an production becomes increasingly social money also dvelopes and exchange becomes a process in itself, the gap between the product as a product and the product as exchange value widens. Money does not drive this process forward, it is the development of these contradictions and antitheses.</p>
<p><em>148</em> Just as the commodity leads a dual existence as a particulary commodity and as money so does the act of exchange split into two mutually independent acts; exchange of commodities for money, exchange of money for commodities.</p>
<p>In this way purchase and sale are non-identical acts, they have achived a spatial and temporal existence which are separate from one another; this creates the opportunity for them to enter into disproportion with one another, it is a source of contradiction.</p>
<p>These acts are also increasingly sepaate from the producers of commodities; exchange for the sake of exchange becomes the driving force rather than exchange for the sake of use; this is the development of mercantilism, an estate which buys in order to sell and sells in order to buy in order to accumulate more money; this can also arise under barter, but with less importance.</p>
<p><em>149</em> This is the origin of commercial crises.</p>
<p>Money overcomes the difficulties of barter by universalising them.</p>
<p><em>150</em> Two of the limitations which assert themselves in crises include i) the fact that commodities are still bound by their concrete aspects; they are prone to deterioration ii) they are connected with the immediate need which another may have or not have at the time.</p>
<p>A contradiction contained in the nature of money is that it comes up against its limitations as universally exchangeable by virtue of being a particular commodity.</p>
<p><em>151</em> In this way it is an inherent property of money to fulfil its puspoese by negating then; to achieve independence form commodities, to be a means which becomes an end, realise the exchange value of commodities by separating them from it.</p>
<p><em>153 - 4</em> Example of how the value form remains in place even when time-chits are used as currency; if it doesn&rsquo;t serve as objectified value it isn&rsquo;t money.</p>
<p><em>156</em> Price and exchange extend back into pre-history but under bourgeois capitalist society costs of production and the predominance of exchange over price govern society to a far greater extent.</p>
<p>Bourgeois economists claim that all individuals pursuing their own private interests serve the totality of interests; Marx makes the point that this could as easily amount to a war of all against all, but makes the point that private interest is itself already socially determined and can be achieved only within the conditions laid down by society and with the means provided by society; it is bound to the reproduction of these conditions and means.</p>
<p><em>157</em> This is obviously a significant transformation from a previously regnant mode of production in which an individual naturally reproduces themselves; under capitalism the social character of production renders private interest subordinate to relations which subsist independently of them; as an alien thing; the less social power the medium of exchange possesses - under feudalism, in antiquity, under the guild system - the greater the power of the community which binds the individuals together.</p>
<p><em>158</em> Relations of personal dependence are the first social forms within which human productive capacity first develops. Personal independence founded on objective dependence is the second form; it is at this point that a system of general social metabolism first develops. Free individuality, based on the universal development of individuals and on their subordination of their communal, social productivity as social wealth is the third stage.</p>
<p>Patriarcak as well as ancient conditions disintegrate with the development of commerce, luxury, money and exchange value while modern society grows in the same measure.</p>
<p>The necessity of transforming individual products and activities into exchange vlue and money so they demonstrate their social power in an objective form proves individuals produce only for society and in society that production is not directly social, rather than individuals are subsumedunder social production, which exists outside them as their fate, social production is not subsumed under individuals and managed by them as their common wealth.</p>
<p><em>159</em> the private exchange of all products of labour stands in antithesis not only to a disribution based on a naturla nad poliitcl super and subordination of individuals based on a natural and political super or subordinations of individuals to one anoher but also to free exchange among individuals who are associatied on the basis of common appropriation and control of the means of produciton.</p>
<p>Just as the divisin of labour crates antithentical forms of unity which bring the antithesis to the fore, agglomeration combination copopertion and the antithesis of private interests, sod oes private exchange create world trade, private indepenendence creates complete dependednce on hte world market and fragmented acts of exchange create a banking and credit system whose books keep a record.</p>
<p>A mass of antithetical forms of the social unity whose antithetical character can never be abolished through quiet metamorphosis,</p>
<p><em>160 - 1</em> the autonomisation of the world market would seem to increases the development of monetary relations and vice versa and as the general bond and overall interdependence in production and conumsption increase with the independence and indifference of consumers and producers to one another and this contradiction leads to crisisl institutions eemrge whereby each individual cn acuire informnation about the activity of all others anad attempt to adjust tehir wn accordingly; lists of curernt prices, rates of exchange, interconnections through those active in commerce through means of communication (Marx uses this to point to the ways in which, though supply and demand are independent of the actions of any one individual, everyone attempts to inform himself about them and this knoweldge reacts back in practice to supply and demand themselves) this holds out the possiblity of socialising production and exchagne.</p>
<p><em>162</em> the indpeendent function of this system certainly renders it more productie and progressive than feudalism but it would be facile to regard it as natural or spontaenous; it is an historic product; it is the bond natrual to individuals within a specific and limited relation of production; they are not products of nature but history.</p>
<p>In earlier stages of production it might appear that the individual is developed more fully because they have not yet worked out their relationships in their fullness or or ereticed them as independent social powers and relations opposite themselves; but it is reactionary and impossible to yearn for their restoration, the bourgeois viewpoint has never advanced beyond this antithesis and this romantic viewpoint.</p>
<p><em>163</em> In underdeveloped productive regimes such as feudalism, relations appear to be personal, but only happen between individuals imprisoend within certain definitions or estates, such as feudal lord, vassla, landlord or serf. Under capitalism these ties are exploded and individuals seem independent, but this is illusory.</p>
<p><em>164</em> In this sense individuals are ruled by abstracitons, which are the theoretical expressions of the material relations.</p>
<p><em>165</em> Important to remember that under feudalism these relations took on an objective character within their own sphere, for example the development of landed propreitarship out of military subordinations proprietorship .</p>
<p><em>166</em> Under feudalism objects which have the most use serve as currency; hides or slaves, while under a society governed by the requirements of exchange precious metals serve as currency precisely because of their less utility as an object of consumption or instruemnnt of production.</p>
<p><em>167</em> the proportiion in which a particular commodity is exchanged for money, is determiend by the amount of albour time objectified in thecommodity, the commodity is an exchange value because it is the realisation ofa  specific amount of labour time; every commodity is continuously exchange for labour time within production; the necessity of money other than labour time arises because the quantitty of labour time must not be expressed in its immediate, particular product but in  mediated geenral product.</p>
<p><em>168</em> The objecitification of hte general social characer of labor is precisely what makes teh product of labour time into exchange value; this is what gives the commodity the attributes of money.</p>
<p><em>173</em> How livestock functons as a measure before it becomes a medium of exchange in antiquity because in barter each commodity is sitll its own medium of exchange, but it cannot be its own measure.</p>
<p><em>174 - 185</em> series of notes on the distinct physical properties of precious metals and their uses across distinct stages of social development.</p>
<p><em>188 - 91</em> A mediation is required for a commodity to be posited as exchange value, in the form of price. Once this mediation is achieved, price has achieved a form of existence separate from the commodity; it is the commodity in an ideal form.</p>
<p><em>193</em> A developed system of prices presupposes the individual no longer directly produces his means of subsistence, but that his direct product is exchange value and must first by mediated as a social process.</p>
<p>In purchase and sale this ideal transformation becomes actual and a particular exchange value must be exchanged for exchange value in general. The commodity is realised as an exchange value only through this mediating movement in which money plays the role of a middleman; it circulates in the opposite direction from commodities.</p>
<p><em>194</em> The point here is that realisation, purchase and sale are all non-identical acts.</p>
<p>What money circulates is not commodities but titles of ownership.</p>
<p>What is realised is no tthe commodities but their exchange value in the form of price.</p>
<p>We have already noted that the quantity of money which is in circulation is determined initially by the prices of the individual commodities and secondly by the quantity of commodities at given prices which enter into circulation; the amount of money required is dpeendended on the level of commodity prices and the quantity of commodities at specified prices as well as the rapidity with which money circulates or completees the task of realisation.</p>
<p>If 1 thaler in one hour makes 10 purchases at 1 thaler each, if it is exchanged 10 times it performsthe same task that 10 thalers would do if they made only 1 purchase per hour.</p>
<p><em>195</em> No matter how many ebbs and floods this quantity of the circulating medium is exposed to an average level always comes into existence, since the permanent changes are always very gradual, take place only over longer periods.</p>
<p><em>198</em> If the commodity cannot be realised in money it can no longer circulate and its price becomes merely imaginary. It then devaluates.</p>
<p><em>199</em> As production becomes less oriented towards immediate subsistence an agent of circulation which can serve as a store of value becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p><em>200</em> Exchange being split into purchase and sale, making them non-simultaneous acts, renders it possible for one to buy without selling (accumulate commodities) or sell without buying (accumulate capital). This turns exchange into a specialised activity; it results in the creation of a merchant estate.</p>
<p><em>201</em> The two distinct types of circulation, which each proceed through three non-identical moments:</p>
<p>i) Commodity -&gt; Money -&gt; Commodity
ii) Money -&gt; Commodity -&gt; Money</p>
<p>In situation i) one sells a commodity in order to get money to get another commodity.</p>
<p>In situation ii) one begins with money, to buy a commodity to sell it for more money.</p>
<p>There is a specific distinction between a commodity in circulation and money in circulation; a commodity fulfills its function by dropping out of circulation, money remains in circulation perpetually.</p>
<p><em>202</em> Exchanging a commodity for another commodity makes sense as individual commodities fulfill specific qualitative functions. Exchanging money for money only makes sense if there is an increase in the amount acquired.</p>
<p><em>203</em> In this way money serves a function that goes beyond its serving as a repository of value and a medium of exchange; it becomes a measure of wealth and an end in itself.</p>
<p><em>206</em> The two commodities being exchanged, the gold for the e.g. bushel of wheat, have nothing to do with one another other than the congealed labour time which render them commensurate.</p>
<p><em>213</em> As the total sum of prices to be realised in circulation changes with the prices of the commodities and with the quantity thrown into circulation and since the velocity of the medium of exchange is determined by circumstances independent of itself, it follows that the quantity of media circulating must be capable of changing, expanding and contracting.</p>
<p>In its role as a medium of circulation it can be said that money ceases to be a particular commodity when its material is irrelevant and it meets only the needs of circulation itself and no other direct need; gold and silver cease to be commodities as soon as they circulate as money.</p>
<p><em>222</em> On how the social form of money facilitates and encourages its accumulation, how greed is the product of a definite social development.</p>
<p><em>223</em> The full development of money necessarily represents the antithesis of the social bonds observed in antiquity; in these periods of history the greed for accumulation can be observed only in the merchant estate; only with the Greeks and Romans does money appear unhampered in its first two functions, as measure and medium of circulation. But as soon as trade develops or conquest brings money in vast quantities, money sppears in its third role and the further it does so the more the decay of their community sets in.</p>
<p>In order to function productively money must be not only the precondition but also the result of circulation; as the Romans acquired money through plunder, this was not the case.</p>
<p>It is inherent in hte simple character of money itself that it can exist as a development moment of prodcution only where and when wage lbour exists, and rather than representing a subversion of the social formation in this case it is a condition for its development anda  driving wheel for the development of all forces of production.</p>
<p>The dissolution of this individual within modern society is in itself only the enrichment of the productive section of society. The owner of money, in the ancient sense is dissolved by the industrial process.</p>
<p><em>224</em> &lsquo;Where money is not itself the community it must dissolve the community&rsquo;</p>
<p><em>[Slavery]</em></p>
<p>In antiquity one could buy a slave but the slave could not make money through his labour. Makes the argument that black slavery &lsquo;a purely industrial slavery&rsquo; is incompatible with the development of bourgeois society and disappears with it and that it presupposes wage labour; if other free states with wage labour did not exist alongside it all social conditions there would immediately return to pre-civilised forms.</p>
<p><em>225</em> The period which precedes the development of modern industrial society opens with a general greed for money on behalf of individuals and nation states; the real development of the sources of wealth take place behind their backs as a means of gaining possession of the representatives of wealth.</p>
<p>Wherever it does not arise out of circulation, as in Spain, but has to be discovered physically, the nation is impoverished, while the nations whcih have to work in order to get it from the Spaniards develop the sources of wealth and really become rich.</p>
<p><em>[Transition to capitalism]</em></p>
<p><em>This is why the search for and discovery of gold in new continents, countries, plays so great a role in the history of revaluation, because by its means colonisation is improvised and made to flourish as if in a hothouse. The hunt for gold in all countries leads to its discovery; the formation of new states; initially to the spread fo commodities, which produce new needs, and draw distant continents into the metabolism of circulation, i.e. exchange. This, in this respect, as the general representative of wealth and as individualised exchange value, it was doubly a means for expanding the universality of wealth, and for drawing hte dimensions of exchange over the whole world; for creating the true generality of exchange value in substance and in extension&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em>227</em> Historical material on gold and silver in the Americas.</p>
<p><em>230</em> Under feudalism and antiquity the accumultion of wealth was undertaken solely for the purpose of possessing wealth as such, a display of overabundance, to finance public works and to gift to gods in temples or security in cases of extreme need to buy arms.</p>
<p>Later in antiquity accumulation becomes political, a state treasury develops and the temple is the first place this is placed.</p>
<p><em>232</em> Historical material linking Protestantism with deflationary spending</p>
<p><em>The Chapter on Capital</em></p>
<p><em>239</em> The difficulty in grasping money in its fully developed character is in its character as a social relation, it is at once a defined object made of metal or stone and a social relation.</p>
<p><em>240</em> It is the most consummate form of exchange value.</p>
<p>Some social reformers have therefore posited that it be made a direct representation of labour-money. This would fail to overcome the nature of exchange value; as long as opposition to the present form of social relations develop the social forms which arise under capitalism transform themselves, this is why social reformers have proposed this programe. But tinkering with the money-form in isoaltion won&rsquo;t resolve these contradictions.</p>
<p><em>241</em> One of the most important functions of money is to render all commodities commensurate with one another, as commodities consist of exchange values, they become equal to one another.</p>
<p><em>243</em> The capacity to satisfy mutual needs, a recognition of common species-being and forms of social life which depend on it is what distinguishes man from the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p><em>244</em> But in exchange society this reciprocity is not the real form of the exchange, the common interest which appears as motive, rather it takes place behind the back of one&rsquo;s individual interest.</p>
<p><em>245</em> Consideration of this as a social form in history and how voluntary exchange was not present in antiquity or in medieval society.</p>
<p><em>248</em> Bourgeois economists overlook these aspects of the process and focus instead on the simplest forms of exchange, the fact of labour and capital acting within them, and incorrectly emphasise the freedom or mutual interest that subsist within them.</p>
<p><em>251</em> Capital is money at a higher stage of social development.</p>
<p><em>252</em> In prior societal modes, this order may be reversed, and a less complete development of value, as in social syswtems based on landed property may be the result. These prior systems are a predicate, a necessary stage of a contemporary system based on capital.</p>
<p>Studying the system of landed property reveals the gradual transforation of the feudal landlord into the landowner, the unfree tenant becoming the modern farmer and the serfs, bondsmen becoming agricultural day-labourers.</p>
<p><em>253</em> Capital comes initially from circulation and its point of departure is money. Money which enters into circulation and at the same time returns from it to itself, it negates itself as something which merely dissolves in circulation but equally negates itself as something which takes up an independent attitude towards circulation. This negation, contains the first elements of capital.</p>
<p>Commercial capital, or circulating capital, is the first form of capital, at which point it is not yet the foundation of production. A more developed form is money capital or money interest, urusy, whose independent appearance belongs also to an earlier stage.</p>
<p>The form C-M-M-C, in which money and circulation appear as mere means for the circulating commodity, which steps outside circulation and satisfies a need, this is teh presupposition of that earlier stge of merchant capital.</p>
<p><em>254</em> The simple movement of exchange values, as in pure circulation, can never realise capital, it can lead to the withdrawal and stockpiling of money, but as soon as money steps back into circulation, it dissolves itself in a sieres of exchange processes with commodities which are consumed, since it is lost as soon as its purchasing power is exhausted.</p>
<p>Circulation therefore does not carry within it the principle of self-renewal.</p>
<p><em>255</em> Commodities are the realisation of definite labour time and are as such values; their presupposition is both the production of commodities by labour and their production of exchange values.</p>
<p><em>258</em> Capital is therefore not a sum of values but a process.</p>
<p><em>259</em> As soon as money is posited as exchagne value which not only becomes independent of circulation but maintains itself through it it is no longer money but capital.</p>
<p><em>260 - 2</em> Series of notes and reflects on the jettisoning of particularity when exchange is understood in the totality and in abstract terms.</p>
<p><em>263</em> The important point to underline here: the means by which capital becomes a process, rather than a tangible thing, and within this process labour too is objectified in the process of its reproduction.</p>
<p><em>266</em> Introduces the notion of labour and capital as antagonistic, one being alien to the other; in the first positing of simple exchange value labour was structured in a way that the product was not a direct use value, not a means of subsistence, but it is teh requirement of exchange.</p>
<p><em>267</em> The use value the worker offers the capitalist is not materialised in a product, does not apepar as apart from him, it exists as potential, as a capacity.</p>
<p>It becomes a reality only when it has been solicited by capital.</p>
<p><em>268 - 9</em> Criticises bourgeois economists whose fundamental criterion is the notion of utility since use is subordinate to exchange in capitalist society and stands in no relation to the substance to such.</p>
<p><em>270</em> Since value has become independent in the form of money it is inherent to its nature to drive beyond its own value. Value preserves itself through increase and does so by constatnyl driving beyond its own quantitative barrier; increasing wealth is an end in itself.</p>
<p><em>272</em> On that basis, the only important use value for capital is labour, and productive labour, as opposed to the provision of services, which is the consumption of revenue and exists within simple circulation: &lsquo;From whore to pope there is a mass of such rabble&rsquo;, as well as the lumpen-proletariat, &rsquo;the great mob of porters&hellip;who render service in seaport cities&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>273</em> Workers are productive insofar as they increase the capital of their master, unproductive as to the material result of their labour.</p>
<p><em>274</em> The worker sells his commodity, labour, which has a use-value and also a price, like all other commodities, for a sum of exchange values.</p>
<p>The capitalist obtains labour as value-positing activity, as productive labour, he obtains the productive force whcih maintains and multiplies capital and which thereby becomes the productive force, a force belonging to capital itself.</p>
<p>These two processes are separate. They can take place at different times and they need not coincide. The first process can be and usually is completed before the second even begins. The completion of the second act presuppose the completion of the product. The payment of wages cannot wait for that.</p>
<p><em>276</em> Capital is the creator of modern landed property or ground rent; just as its action therefore appears also as the dissoluton of the old form of property on land. Capital is therefore the creatior of modern agriculture.</p>
<p>Once wage labour is created the propreitor clears the land of excess mouths and transforms labour on teh soil itself into a mediated source of subsistence. Only then is the application of science possible and the full forces of production unleashed; industrial development becomes possible.</p>
<p><em>277</em> Wage labour in its classic form is something permeating the entire expanse of society is therefore created by modern landed property.</p>
<p>Merchant capital can emerge without this transformation taking place, but not industrial capital; even the development of manufacture requires this to happen.</p>
<p>Only with the development of modern industry t a high degree does this dissolution at individual points acquire its totality and extent, but it occurs more rapidly to the degree that modern agriculture and the form of property have developed.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the first form of industry, large-scale manufacture presupposes dissolution of landed property, this dissolution is conditions by the subordinate development of capital in its primitive medieval forms which has taken place in cities and at the same time the effect of manufacture and trade flourishing in other counries, the example offered is the influence of Holland on England in teh sixteenth and the first half of the seventeeth century; these counries had already undergone the process, agriculture had been sacrified to cattle-raising and grain was obtained from those countries which had been developmentally outstripped, such as Poland.</p>
<p><em>278</em> While in the bourgeois system every economic relation presupposes every other and everyting posited is thus also a presupposition this is the case with every organic system, which, as a totality, has its presuppositions; its development in its totality consists in subordinating all elements of society to itself, or creating out of it the organs which it still lacks, this is how it becomes a totality.</p>
<p>If, within one society, capital seizes conrol of the relations of production and develops productive forces to their totality this society seizes control of another, e.g. colonies then its representative, the capitalit, finds that his capacity ceases to be capital without wage labour and that one of the presuppositons of teh latter is not only landed property in geenral but modern landed property, which as capitalised rent, is expensive and whcih, as such, excludes the directuse of the soil by individuals.</p>
<p>Hence colonisation; landed property is here artifically made more expensive to transform the workers into wage workeers, make capital act as capital and to make the colony productive, to develop wealth in it, instead of using it for the momentary deliverance of the wage labourers as in America.</p>
<p><em>279 - 281</em> Notes on colonies and the world market.</p>
<p><em>282</em> The wage system gives the impression that the worker has a share in the product; if the worker receives money, exchange value, the geenral form of wealth he has received a greater or lesser share in the value of the product he produces, but the exchange value of his commodity cannot be determined by the manner in whcih the buyer uses it, only the amount of objectified labour contained in it, by the amount of labour required to reproduce the worker himself, the use value he offers exists only as an ability, as a capacity of his bodily existence, it has no existence apart from that.</p>
<p><em>283</em> The appropriate measure of teh amount of value, the sum of money, the woker obtains in exchange is the objectified labour necessarily bodily to maintain the general substance in whcih his labour power exists but also that required to modify this general substance so as to develop its particular capacity.</p>
<p>The worker&rsquo;s life is the source in which his own use value constantly re-kindles itself up to a certain time when it is worn out and constantly confronts capital again in order to begin the exchange anew.</p>
<p>Since he exchanges his use value for the general form of wealth he becomes co-participant in general wealth up o the limit of his equivalent; a quantitative limit which turns into a qualitative one, as in every exchange.</p>
<p>The worker is distinct from the slave in the sense that the sphere of his consumption is not qualitatively restricted but quantitatively except insofar as the qualitative is posited through the quantitative.</p>
<p><em>284</em> Because the worker receives the equivalent in the form of money, there is a semblance of equality with the capitalist; but this semblance exists as an illusion on his part; what he obtains from the exchange is not wealth, but a means of subsistence, objects for the peservation of his life.</p>
<p><em>285</em> It is theoretically possible for the worker to use their wages to accumulate wealth; bourgeois economists issue apologia for exploitation along these lines, calling on the owrkers to practice self-denial, there is some notion that this is what capitalists have done in order to accumulate their wealth. This is of course an exception to the relation.</p>
<p><em>286</em> If as a class workers succeed in raising their general level of industriousness they increase not the value of the commodity but its quantity; if they all save, a general reduction of wages would reduce their conditions once again, for general savings would demonstrate to the capitalist that their wages are too high, that they are receiving more than its equivalent for their labour.</p>
<p>An individual worker can be more industrious on average, more than he has to be in order to labour, only because another, in the average, works less. The most he can achieve on the average is to be better able to endure the fluctuations of prices; he can manage his consumption better, but never attain wealth; the capitalists demand that they always hold a minimum of life&rsquo;s pleasures to make crises easier to bear for the capitalist.</p>
<p><em>288</em> If the worker is to ameliorate their station through accumulation via savings at a certain point the saved-up money has to become capital, establishing at another point the contradiction that bourgeois philanthropists are seeking to overcome.</p>
<h1 id="notebook-iii">Notebook III</h1>
<p><em>294</em> What the struggle for reductions in the working day provdes is that the capitalists prefers for the worker to squander their dosage of vital force as much as possible without interruption.</p>
<p>No wealth is created in exchange, either for the capitalist, because for the latter the payment of money is a sacrifice of wealth not its creation, for whcih he aims to pay as small an amount as possible, nor for teh worker, because it brings him only subsistence, the satisfaction of individual needs.</p>
<p><em>295</em> The worker who exchanges his commodity goes through the cycle C - M - M - C in the exchange process. If the point of departure in circulation is the commodity we necessarily arrive back at the commodity, since money appears only as coin and as a medium of exchange is only a vanishing mediation; while the commodity as such is consumed as the direct object of need.</p>
<p>Capital represents the opposite movement M - C - C - M.</p>
<p><em>295 - 6</em> Account of the differences between concrete and abstract labour; the former being specific and particular to the material(s) to which it is applied, the latter existing in a totality, indifferent to specificity but capable of encompassing all of them.</p>
<p><em>297</em> This opposition between capitalist and worker, capital and labour develops more purely and adequately in proportion as labour loses all characteristics of art, as its particular skill becomes something more and more a purely abstract or mechanical activity.</p>
<p><em>298</em> It is this process of differentiation and suspension, in which capital bcomes a process. On one side the objectivity to which it exists has to be cosumed by labour, on the other there mere subjectivity of labour as a mere form has to be suspended and labour is objectified in the material of capital.</p>
<p><em>300</em> Bourgeois economists only regard money in the form of articles of consumption and use-values obtained through exchange, rather than a capacity in every predicate of general wealth.</p>
<p>In reality there are discrete sequences of productive consumption underlying these activities; Marx explains them through chemical metaphors.</p>
<p><em>302</em> Once again, capital is a passive presence in the process, as objective being in whcih the formal character which makes it capital - the socail relation - is extinguished because cotton or yarn or cloth enters into the process as material existences which certain natural properties; how these were posited in them makes no difference to the relation of living labour towards them; living labour does not really relate to the objectified labour in the object,.</p>
<p><em>304</em> Hegelian account of capital abolishing itself to realise / multiply itself in production.</p>
<p><em>305</em> It is correct to say that capital is not productive in the sense that it is merely the object or material that confronts labour, but it is more correct to say that it does not appear as any of the aspects of the productive process, nor their differences but rather as the self-propelling content of the process in general.</p>
<p>Productive labour is labour which produces capital. The piano maker is productive, but not the piano player, who only exchanges labour for revenue. The player might produce music but that does not make it productive labour anymore than &rsquo;the madman who produces delusions&rsquo;; labour becomes productive by producing its own opposite.</p>
<p>Labour as a use-value exists only for capital, it does not belong to the worker who has no access to it.</p>
<p><em>306</em> The use value of a thing does not concern its seller, but its buyer. The property of a commodity does not determine its price but the cost of producing it, the amount of labour incarnated within it.</p>
<p><em>307</em> The worker therefore sells labour as a simple, pre-determined exchange value, determined by a previous process - as objectified labour, he sells it only insofar as it already objectifies a definite amount of labour; capital buys it as the general productive force of wealth.</p>
<p>In this way, the worker cannot become rich since in exchange for his labour capacity as a fixed available magnitude he surrenders its creative power, he necessarily impoverishes himself because capital confronts him and realises itself as an alien power, which appropriates living labour.</p>
<p><em>308</em> Capital cannot therefore be productive in and of itself.</p>
<p><em>311</em> It is not the point that in the course of the productive process that raw material achieves a higher status qua object, rather that it attains to a higher exchange value.</p>
<p><em>312</em> Raw material may be used up in the course of the production process but all that has changed is the material in relation to value; it does not change the latter.</p>
<p><em>313</em> The value of the product = value of the raw material + the value of the part of the instrument which has been destroyed, i.e. transferred to the product, which is suspended in its original form + the value of the labour.</p>
<p><em>314 - 5</em> Value is increased in the production process</p>
<p><em>318</em> The very existence of interest demonstrates that the cost of production is not the sum of values which enter into production; for the industrial capitalist interest is among his real costs of production and interest itself already presupposes capital emerges from production as surplus value, since interest is itself only one form of this surplus.</p>

<p><strong>The So-called Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p><em>9</em> Credit is the lending of money in the expectation that the money will be paid back later along with a bonus or dividend in the form of a rate of interest. This is not necessarily a capitalist mechanism, co-operative societies can issue credit as well as building societies.</p>
<p><em>10</em> What makes banks distinct is their use of credit involves the creation of money; banks can be giving overdrafts to everyone in the economy at one time.</p>
<p>As such far more money is circulating in the economy than the amount of money derived from savings generated by past value creation.</p>
<p>Part of this money is fictitious; money derived not from the success of past investments but expectations that it will be validated by future productive activity.</p>
<p><em>11</em> As banks are crucial for the functioning of the global economy nation states constantly interfere in their operations, even though ideologically it makes sense to do so on the down low.</p>
<p>Without fictitious credit money economic development would be happening much slower; if employers could only invest real savings investments would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Modern economies therefore run to a large extent on debt.</p>
<p>Markets have developed around companies selling legal claims on future profits which the company may generate in the future as shares.</p>
<p><em>12</em> These securities markets, operated in by speculators and rentiers, do not contribute to productive investment; they are based on the buying and seeling of claims on future value created in productive activity.</p>
<p><strong>The Two Poles of Capitalism and their Regulation</strong></p>
<p><em>13</em> The interests and behaviours of productive capital and money capital are not identical.</p>
<p><em>14</em> The money capitalist will prefer to keep their money in a liquid form and be attentive to hot flows of cash.</p>
<p>Productive capital pursues more long-term circuits particularly w/r/t fixed capital investment, which only yield their value over long periods.</p>
<p>Gowan argues that the latter cohort were dominant in the postwar period up until about 50 years ago, when the former overtook them.</p>
<p><strong>The International Monetary System</strong></p>
<p><em>15</em> The formation of an international currency system arises from the need that exists for different states to do business which each other.</p>
<p>This is done either through a third currency which has an exchange price between the two currencies, such as gold.</p>
<p>Another option is an established exchange rate between the two currencies; the seller of the goods may be prepared to accept payment in either of the two currencies.</p>
<p>These inter-state exchanges are very closely monitored; if a state is heavily in deficit questions arise as to whether they will be able to pay off their loans.</p>
<p><em>16</em> This credibility question can be settled in a number of ways; a state may cut back their purchases from abroad, the state in surplus may be pressured to buy more from the state in deficit.</p>
<p>The former will have a depressive effect, the latter will stimulate economic activity, but ultimately it is the larger more powerful states which set the terms.</p>
<p><strong>The Bretton Woods Regime for International Monetary and Financial Relations</strong></p>
<p>In advancing an international monetary system after the war John Maynard Keynes and Dexter White aimed to create a predictable, stable and rule-based order that could not be manipulated by larger states.</p>
<p>Gold would therefore be retained as the anchor of the system; it would be separate from the currency of every nation state, and the dollar would have its price fixed against gold.</p>
<p>Every other nation state would then fix their currency prices against the dollar and could not change that price as they wished to. Changes in the price of currency would be determined co-operatively between states via a supra-national body, the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The IMF would accept a change in a currency&rsquo;s price only if it was needed to correct a fundamental disequilibrium in the state&rsquo;s current account.</p>
<p>This would ensure economic operators benefitted from stability in the prices of the main currencies.</p>
<p>The Keynes-White system, or Bretton-Woods, would also ban private financial operators from moving funds around the world freely; states would have authority to control and restrict these movements.</p>
<p><em>17</em> The two states who devised this system, the US and the UK, became increasingly hostile towards Bretton-Woods: it was drawn up before the Cold War began and was therefore out of step with US imperial strategy.</p>
<p>During the Vietnam war the US economy entered into a structural deficit, exacerbated by the capital the US was exporting to Western Europe to maintain its dominance in their markets.</p>
<p>The US could have stabilised its economy by cutting back on its military expenditures, reduced its imports or devalued the dollar against gold, but instead the Nixon administration set out to destroy the Bretton-Woods regime.</p>
<p>This aligned with the interests of Wall Street and the City of London, who found their activities were restricted by Bretton Woods.</p>
<p><em>3: The Dollar-Wall Street Regime</em></p>
<p><strong>The Inauguration and Structure of the Dollar-Wall Street Regime</strong></p>
<p><em>20</em> Support for a single pure dollar standard had been advocated within the Nixon administration by Paul Volcker; the international monetary crisis of 1971 provided an opportunity, against Japanese and European opposition.</p>
<p><em>21</em> The Nixon administration also moved to place responsibility for financial regulation in the hands of private financial operators.</p>
<p>This was done by exerting pressure on the Europeans indirectly, by pressuring Gulf States to raise the price of oil.</p>
<p>European and Japanese economies entered into trade deficits as the costs of oil imports rose; the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through western banking systems to non-oil-producing states, rather than the IMF.</p>
<p><em>22</em> The destruction of Bretton-Woods brought speculative capital into the centre of a new international monetary system which operated in a manner qualitatively distinct from its predecessor.</p>
<p>Banks were also allowed to shed existing liquidity requirements and other regulative mechanisms.</p>
<p><em>23</em> This strengthened the hand of the American state and altered the relationships between states.</p>
<p>States in trade surplus had strong, stable currencies. If a state developed current account deficits, it needed foreign exchange reserves to defend its currency or appeal to the IMF to help.</p>
<p>Currency stability therefore depends on a state&rsquo;s creditworthiness in international markets.</p>
<p><em>24</em> States eager to maintain currency stability are further integrated into American markets as it is in their best interests to retain their foreign currency reserves in dollars.</p>
<p><strong>The Economic and Political Significance of Dollar Seigniorage</strong></p>
<p><em>25</em> The US is therefore not not bound by the same balance of payments restraints that other nations are: it can spend far more abroad than it earns and can therefore set up military bases, have transnational companies buy up foreign firms effectively without limit.</p>
<p>American companies are also less exposed to international price fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>The Economic and Political Significance of Wall Street Dominance</strong></p>
<p><em>28</em> Wall Street, being able to dictate international interest rates, can therefore determine the cost of credit.</p>
<p><em>29</em> When Americans deregulate their financial institutions it puts enormous pressure on regulative mechanisms in other states, as their competitors lobby for similarly light-touch regimes.</p>
<p>US governments also use the World Bank and the IMF to bail out their own financial institutions when they reach a point of insolvency with no cost to the US economy.</p>
<p><em>35</em> One of the paradoxes of this situation is that financial crises in the Global South do not weaken the regime but strengthen it; private wealth-holders move their money from the Global South to the US and the insolvent state has to export to the US to find the resources for debt servicing.</p>
<p><em>4: The Evolution of the DWSR from the 1970s to the 1990s</em></p>
<p><strong>The US Policy for the Evolution of the DWSR from Nixon to 1993</strong></p>
<p><em>40</em> Under Reagan economic growth was to be driven by deregulation of the banking and financial sectors, tax cuts for the wealthy and deficit spending on defense.</p>
<p>The new dominance afforded to money capital, and a drive to contain inflation, spurred employers to begin an assault on the power of organised labour and working conditions.</p>
<p>The Brits, the Germans, the French, the Italians and the Danish also rolled back their capital controls through the European Single Market.</p>
<p><em>41</em> A policy of high dollar and high interest rates led to Latin American and Central European debt crises in the early eighties.</p>
<p>Reagan took advantage of these debt crises to re-organise social relations in the distressed economies to the benefit of their own capitalist class.</p>
<p><strong>The American Political Economy</strong></p>
<p><em>53</em> There has been an enormous decline in the role of commercial banks in the supply of credit to the productive sector with the rise of mutual funds, which offer credit to companies in the form of bonds rather than bank loans. The depositors benefit from higher interest rates as well as the funds&rsquo; diverse portfolios of bonds and other securities.</p>
<p>Thus the supply of money capital to American employers is tied in with the rise and fall of prices on securities markets; the savings of Americans of all classes are tied into price movements on these markets.</p>
<p>Walls have also broken down between different sections of the financial sector; the savings and loans institutions have also been integrated into securities markets.</p>
<p>New types of securities have also been developed, whether in mortgage contracts or unregulated derivatives, which involve trading in securities whose prices are derived from their movements in other primary securities or currencies.</p>
<p>Derivatives link price movements in one market (shares or bonds) with another (foreign exchange). Price shocks therefore become more contagious.</p>
<p><em>54</em> Another development is the invention of hedge funds; speculative organisations which make money by buying and selling securities on their own account to exploit price movements over time and price differentials between markets.</p>
<p>Important to note that these are not marginal speculators but are produced by some of the largest investment banks and mutual funds so the banks can engage in tax-free speculative activities off the books.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are so large they can shift prices in the market in the direction they want through their sheer scale; hedge funds leverage amounts of money hundreds of times in excess of their actual size.</p>
<p><em>55</em> With an attenuated regulatory order, the USian state apparatus largely captured by the power of finance.</p>
<p>The systemic importance of securities markets means the USian economy is hugely vulnerable to collapse.</p>
<p><em>Power Politics, the DWSR and the Clinton Administration</em></p>
<p><strong>1 National Interests and International Challenges</strong></p>
<p><em>64</em> The tendency towards monopoly under capitalism is strong because advanced industry tends to have very high capital-output ratios (Marx refers to this as the organic composition of capital), meaning each extra unit of capital investment results in a relatively small amount of value add.</p>
<p>Very large investments in fixed capital are needed to enter the sector and capitalists who make such outlays have to be reassured of long-term market control so they can realise an adequate return on their capital.</p>
<p>States are enlisted to solve these problems by providing large state-markets for monopolistic industries and providing a large range of support services (infrastructure, labour training etc.)</p>
<p>This tendency towards monopolisation in advanced economies can have serious knock-on effects; if big monopolies in control of large swathes of a market collapse this has serious consequences.</p>
<p><em>65</em> States and their militaries are also enlisted to ensure private access to raw materials, such as aluminium, bauxite and copper.</p>

			<description>The idea of this story as representing a protagonist subject to a very nineteenth century medical regime of isolation by a domineering husband will be familiar, but I see it more as dealing with the notion of phases of historical development. The walls, gates and labourer’s homes her windows look out onto partaking of the residua of a feudal order, her husband with his reliance on that which is quantifiable, not to mention her own desire being channelled through a wish to make herself useful in gainful labour are all suggestive of the new order of things yet to consolidate themselves, the yellow wallpaper its interior accompaniment.</description>

<p>Under the sustained gaze of the unnamed protagonist, the wallpaper becomes a site of contradiction, its ‘outrageous angles’ and ‘unheard-of contradictions’, seeming to warn of self-destruction and suicide, the subtext to the avant-garde, but in this oscillation between its ‘debased romanesque’ classicism and abstraction, it holds out great promise, particularly in the woman who will occasionally appear behind it, and seems to move with more freedom than the protagonist does.</p>
<p>The discourse occasionally will identify this woman with a projection of her unconscious, but this seems to me to be a misprision, or concession to the idea that she is mentally ill; l; based on physical descriptions of her stalking the house, it seems fairly clear to me that it is her or how she might be, given some revolutionary re-ordering of things as they are</p>

			<description>Ernest Hemingway’s novel Torrents of Springis not very good. An author’s note at its end informs us that it was written in ten days and if this account of its composition is true, it very much shows. The reason I am choosing to inflict this reading experience on myself is because of my PhD research; my stylometric analysis of nineteenth and twentieth century literature, which involves identifying words which are particular to each author, informs me that Torrents of Spring marks a departure from Hemingway’s usual range of expression, away from words like ‘hell’, ‘bottle’, ‘drink’, ‘hit’ and ‘you’re’, to words like ‘wife’, ‘woman’, ‘happiest’, ‘agreed’, and ‘herself’, words Hemingway does not use anywhere else in his oeuvre.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ernest Hemingway’s novel Torrents of Springis not very good. An author’s note at its end informs us that it was written in ten days and if this account of its composition is true, it very much shows. The reason I am choosing to inflict this reading experience on myself is because of my PhD research; my stylometric analysis of nineteenth and twentieth century literature, which involves identifying words which are particular to each author, informs me that Torrents of Spring marks a departure from Hemingway’s usual range of expression, away from words like ‘hell’, ‘bottle’, ‘drink’, ‘hit’ and ‘you’re’, to words like ‘wife’, ‘woman’, ‘happiest’, ‘agreed’, and ‘herself’, words Hemingway does not use anywhere else in his oeuvre. It’s worth pointing out that Hemingway wrote Torrrents of Spring as a satire of Sherwood Anderson’s novel Dark Laughter. How successful it is in this regard I don’t know, what I am more interesting in tracing, is the opportunity Hemingway takes to launch a broadside against the modernist project at large.</p>
<p>There’s not a page that goes by that Hemingway does not satirise the prose styles of either Gertrude Stein (‘Yogi Johnson walking down the silent street with his arm around the little Indian’s shoulder. The big Indian walking along beside them. The cold night. The shuttered houses of the town. The little Indian, who has lost his artificial arm. The big Indian, who was also in the war. Yogi Johnson, who was in the war too’) the more folksy thoughts of Leopold Bloom (‘What is that old writing fellow Shakespear says?’) or the weightier thematising of D.H. Lawrence (‘In some ways the pump-factory had hardened him. His speech had become more clipped. More like these hardy Northern workers’). More than these individual examples however is the broader alienation or discomfort intergral to modern life in industrialised Anglosphere after the first world war, summed up in the persistent refrain: ‘What was it all about? Where was it taking her?’</p>
<p>This is a familiar story underpinning literary modernism’s emergence, and we know well the formal strategies which emerge as a means of containing the modern sensibility, be it fragmentation, referentiality, the drawing on literary antecedents as a guarantor of one’s own fundamental seriousness. And none of these emerge unscathed either. The waitress at the diner to whom one of the main characters becomes engaged is from the Lake District (‘Wordworth’s country’ comes the helpful gloss), for instance.</p>
<p>The culmination of all this comes in Hemingway’s solicitous addresses to the reader which are interleaved throughout the text, about his luncheons with John Dos Passos and how F. Scott FitzGerald’s just been by, and how difficult it was to research the history of Native American tribes in the last chapter and if the reader has a manuscript themselves to drop it by one of the cafés, etc. Subtlety is obviously not what Hemingway’s about here, but it’s an interesting observation on the tension between what the modernist project said about itself and how Hemingway regarded it in practice. Rather than being founded on autonomy and transcendence, it inculcates a cult of the author and whatever mastery they exhibit over their materials. The insular gossip culture of Paris travels as far as Petoskey, Michigan, with factory workers and waitresses trading anecdotes about Henry James’ last words and Ford Madox Ford’s encounters with high society. It is this sublimated, parasocial aspect to the modern that is most noteworthy in Torrents of Spring, and certainly appears to be the most enduring, based on how the vast majority of them are now marketed (‘just think of it, H.G. Wells talking about you right in our home. Anyway, H.G. Wells’). The final author’s note, injuncting the reader to tell their friends about the book if they enjoyed it because of how hard it is to shift units these days, make clear in precise terms what these poses, aesthetic though they may be, are really all about.</p>

			<description>McCormack’s novel Solar Bones can be regarded as of a piece with the resurgence of Irish neo-modernism, enacted variously by writers such as Anne Enright, Eimear McBride, Sara Baume, Joanna Walsh and Claire Louise-Bennett. The motivations underpinning neo-modernism in other sectors, be it the academy, poetry, performance art and architecture, are highly varied and will not be treated in full here. I would contend that these writers in particular have advanced modernist aesthetics in the name of a feminist agenda, deterritorialising the masculinist stylistic tropes formerly associated with writers such as James Joyce, Samuel Beckett et al.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>McCormack’s novel Solar Bones can be regarded as of a piece with the resurgence of Irish neo-modernism, enacted variously by writers such as Anne Enright, Eimear McBride, Sara Baume, Joanna Walsh and Claire Louise-Bennett. The motivations underpinning neo-modernism in other sectors, be it the academy, poetry, performance art and architecture, are highly varied and will not be treated in full here. I would contend that these writers in particular have advanced modernist aesthetics in the name of a feminist agenda, deterritorialising the masculinist stylistic tropes formerly associated with writers such as James Joyce, Samuel Beckett et al. and putting it to radical political ends. McCormack’s modernism, I argue, aligns him more closely with his Anglophone peer Will Self, who tends to distillate their writing through quite academic notions of ‘what ‘proper’ modernism shouldlook like’. Self, in his war against the modern reader and their smartphone, seems to have adopted modernism as a rearguard action against post-modernity’s fallout, seeing it as the only means of producing ‘a new classicism’. This formalist objective has the effect that some of the texts in his modernist trilogy can take on the shape of a normative or flatpack modernism. Solar Bones, far from being as schematic as Umbrella,neverthelessengages very deliberately with the notion of the individual in society and how that broader ‘mass’ might best be understood from a narrative perspective, belying its distillation through quite scholarly theories of ‘what modernism is’.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, contrary to many, many reviews reporting the opposite, Solar Bones is not composed of one long sentence.Solar Bonescontains paragraphs, margins, and the rhythm is always subject to an intensely calculated amount of control, which renders the text an eminently readable one. What these paragraphs do facilitate, is a break with chronological time, and any given blank space might bring the reader anywhere from ‘the present’, an hour in the life of the novel’s protagonist Marcus Conway, to his childhood, his late adolescence, or an average working day before the event of his retirement. This disconnectedness exists less to fragment than to illuminate, to represent Galway as existing within a global totality, with references to news events such as the transmission of H5N1 across species barriers, car bombings in Baghdad, pessimistic economic forecasts, or the west of Ireland’s unconstructed water infrastructure inert on a drawing board in Ottawa. His games with time and space allow McCormack to realise in novelistic form, the impersonal political and economic forces which govern the life of every citizen in the state, as in this paragraph in which his daughter’s birth certificate is signed:</p>
<p><em>it fixed her within a political structure which undertook to spend a percentage of its GDP on her health and her education and her defence among other things and over twenty years later I can still feel something of that mysterious pride which swept through me as I sat there behind the steering wheel, the uncanny feeling that my child was elevated into something above being my daughter or my own flesh and blood — there was a metaphysical reality to her now — she had stepped into that political index which held a space for her in the state’s mindfulness, a place that was hers alone and could not be occupied by anyone else</em></p>
<p>The quotation above is indicative of a scope and ambition of Solar Bones, rarely glimpsed elsewhere in Irish fiction, which allows McCormack to delve into issues such as emigration, without dependence on prior convention, and present a convincing portrait of late-stage capitalism, a mode of production in which his son Darragh, has far less in the way of career prospects than he did, and the steady paternalist order which he represents, is slowly fading away. All of this serves to make McCormack a novelist as good as bringing politics into conversation with literature which refracts reality as anyone writing in Ireland today (Anne Enright aside).</p>
<p>One might almost frame the style as the realisation of the dialectic in literary form, minutely tuned to the mechanics of action, reaction, stimulus and response. This is not to say that it is immune to being overcooked at times, ‘giddy fit of enraged irrationality’ being just one example. McCormack’s cadences can be so expertly balanced that he winds up in a compulsive even-handedness. Solar Bones thereby becomes a machine for the reproduction of its own style, which enacts in turn a significant number of exclusions, constructions and silences. The political ramifications of this are most visible when Marcus describes his son’s concept of a role-playing game based on the H-Block hunger strikes in the eighties:</p>
<p><em>all his night spent poring over accounts of the hunger strike till he had amassed a broad and detailed comprehension of the background material and the complex political context in which the strike occurred with all its ebbs and flows, all its moves and countermoves</em></p>
<p>All these ebbs, flows, moves and countermoves produce a gentle and rocking inflection which imply that the conflict was in some sense equal, rather than determined by coercion exerted by the British state and the desperate strategies which arise in response to occupation. Another example, when Marcus speaks about his voting preferences:</p>
<p><em>I have, through the years, voted left, right and centre, each time doing so with some shade of that solemn meeting at the gable of the house renewing itself and prompting me, time and again that sense of consequence which attends putting a stroke on a ballot paper coming to me in the prvacy of the voting booth as it did</em></p>
<p>Here we see the return of the gentle, rolling and rollicking, and elegant dip and bend, precise whirling and turning and ripping and riving and jumping and jiving of the sentence almost weaving in and out before our eyes, as though the choices being weighed up in the voting booth were somehow neutral; when society is viewed as being interconnected, and subject to thermodynamic laws of reaction/counter-reaction, everything is flattened, and class struggle is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>It is through Marcus’ vocation as an engineer and his increasing disenchantment with Irish politics, its failed attempts to make manifest an authentic spirit of social democracy that the book’s political disposition is most legible. Twice in the text, Marcus’ expertise is frustrated by gombeen men, aspiring parliamentarians and councillors pushing a parish-pump agenda, trying to get their photographs taken on the front of local newspapers to secure re-election rather than building a sustainable infrastructure. At one point the gombeen politician begins to sound like Marcus’ parochial cosmology, which I don’t think was the intended effect:</p>
<p><em>I’ve spent the last three years trying to build an electoral base in the south-west corner of this county, the largest and most far-flung constituency in the whole country — leaflets, clinics, church gate collections — the whole lot, anything to harvest a quota of first preferences in an area with no major urban centre, just a few scattered villages, an area which is, by and large covered with some of the wildest bogs and the highest mountains in the whole province, an area populated in the main by black-faced sheep, none of whom, to the best of my knowledge has the vote, because if they did I would be sitting on a nice fat surplus…till then I have to take to the highways and the byways of this country for funerals and festivals</em></p>
<p>highways/byways, funerals/festivals, ebbs/flows, moves/countermoves…</p>
<p>This even-handedness is most detectable in the novel’s representation of the 1977 general election, the year in which the Fine Gael/Labour coalition was wiped out by Fianna Fáil under Jack Lynch. However, no party, nor key political figure is named. Instead we get euphemisms such as ‘law and order party’, ‘blue and green’. This may sound unfair on McCormack, and may well be due to Ireland’s libel laws, but I feel very strongly that it is a tremendous loss to Irish literature that Liam Cosgrave does not appear in a televised address during the biggest failure of his political career, or indeed during the campaign when he pledged to run down English elements of our commentariat like ‘mongrel foxes’, which is to say nothing of how much hay he could have made with Labour TD James Tully’s catastrophic attempts to re-draw the national constituency boundaries in advance of the election. In occasions such as this the form of the novel seems to be at odds with its attempt to make a serious political intervention; while the novel does the local and the global well, the national between these layers seems to be missed.</p>
<p>I find this novel’s choice to elide all the systems at work on the national level, while representing and naming two incompetent and cynical gombeen men and thereby implicitly diagnose irish politics’ problem as a populist spirit aiming at fulfilling the grubby wishes of unwashed rural voter unfortunate, and too much an outgrowth of views expressed in many sectors of our media, both national and private. Marcus isn’t a saint, but i’d argue the novel positions him as a benevolent philosopher king, capable of making long-term decisions that our political system of proportional representation cannot. This is attested to by his narrative ability to zoom out and ‘go cosmic’, both throughout the body of the novel (the mundane nature of everyday reality and memory considered through the screen of modernist sentencing expanding and expanding until its takes on the shape of a window into the universal) and at its end, when he begins to sense the beginning of a communion with God, ‘a fellow engineer’.</p>
<p>This is underlined by the fact that his wife remains, like Molly Bloom, very much rooted in the physical, the only time she touches the face of the divine is, quite revealingly in my view, in the context of ‘fucking the world into redemption’. Her being infected with the cryptosporidium parasite (her various physical ailments, discharges receives no small amount of narrative attention) places her in the realm of the fleshly, which is to say nothing of the young attractive waitress Marcus eyes up for a bit too long in a café towards the end. (Please, please, please, can I never read another novel where a middle-aged man lustily eyes up a young woman). Women have bodies, they are flesh, associated with food, sex, sickness and warmth, men are cold, have thoughts, think about politics, eventualities, the future, what roads are made of, they’re Angry, but in a way that’s somehow Important. Men’s thoughts are the stuff of novels, while women undress themselves, parade naked in the streets performing inscrutable (and perhaps frivolous) performance art and create installations.</p>
<p>I am, in case this is not clear, talking about Marcus’ daughter, Agnes. Agnes is a visual artist, whose major work takes the form of a sequence of excerpts from local newspapers:</p>
<p>*when I got him to the ground, Your Honour, I administered</p>
<p>we have stood by him even though he has caused us untold grief</p>
<p>a series of consecutive slaps, Your Honour*</p>
<p>which appear to Marcus as follows:</p>
<p><em>the red script which covered the entire gallery from ceiling to floor along its length, handwriting in various types and sizes, a continuous swathe of text…all dealing with court cases which covered the full gamut from theft and domestic violence to child abuse, public order offences, illegal grazing on protected lands, petty theft, false number plates, public affray, burglary, assault and drink-driving offences…rising and falling in swells and eddies through various sizes and spacings, congested in the tight rhythms of certain examples only to swell out in crashing typographical waves in others, a maelstrom of voices and colour</em></p>
<p>Now, for me, this description amounts to nothing less than the text’s repressed stylistic unconscious, and its attempts to put a shape onto the restlessness of postmodern experience breaking through the polished, male, modernist veneer. The maelstrom of voices, the subterranean accounts of voiceless victims of state exclusion battling with The Great Narrative of the Declining Man; it’s no wonder Marcus nearly gets sick and has to leave the gallery. Marcus is an old-fashioned realist, who dislikes his son use of the term ‘onto-political’ and rubbishes revolutionary proposals for political change because he views it as impossible to get hard-nosed rural voters on board with workers’ soviets. He prefers instead the causality of modernist time, the supra-structure, after which the novel is named:</p>
<p>upholding the world like solar bones, that rarefied amalgam of time and light whose extension through every minute of the day is visible from the moment I get up in the morning and stand at the kitchen window with a mug of tea in my hand, watching the first cars of the day passing on the road, every one of them known to me</p>
<p>It would be great to see McCormack’s next work take on issues related to the troika and the recession, one in which would require him to name names, and might pressure a narrator such as Marcus to investigate the root causes behind the normative governing structures of the country he’s representing being put under greater and greater levels of pressure.</p>

A woman, acting as a pregnant mother in period dress, speaks in a Dublin accent about how she lives like the gentry here, not that the gentry are known for buying second-hand bonnets in Capel Street. As she speaks, coughing can be heard from a neighbouring room, and she wishes her children dead, so as to spare them their long, drawn-out illness. One or two of the tourists incline their heads sympathetically. She turns away from them as the wheezing becomes more pronounced.</em></p>
<p>One could say that Pat Collins is a filmmaker concerned with Irish identity, but this would not be quite right, as he is just as interested in Irish difference. His body of work to date, in its movement between essay, documentary, and biopic manifests the restlessness in idea in motion and thus appear to us remote from convention. His most recent film, Song of Granite represents something of a culmination of his work to date, and, with the recognition that it his is a career still underway, provides us with an opportunity to consider his major works in sequence.</p>
<p><em>John McGahern: A Private World</em> is the first of Collins’ portraits of artists living in remote parts of the country. Collins’ interest in the landscape is already manifest, with long, reflective shots of ferns, large bodies of water and McGahern walking through narrow laneways with his dog. These shots are imbued with the spaciousness and composition of footage one would expect to find in an installation, over which McGahern recalls his childhood, or reads selections from his prose. Despite the scenery, it is a film more concerned with the world within than the world without. When McGahern does speak of society at large, it is a distant and risible thing; he describes the banning of his novel The Dark as ‘foolish’ and says he did not appeal the decision because he thought the novel was not worth the effort. McGahern’s deliberate manner of speaking, only raising his voice in relaying the words of an embittered Irish emigrant in London, work in tandem with Collins’ tendency to ruminate upon landscape and allows the film to attain the stately atmosphere of McGahern’s fiction, serving just as well as an adaptation of McGahern’s works as it as does as a documentary on the man who wrote them.</p>
<p>Despite the film’s focus on isolated settings, politics begin to seep in, as McGahern mentions Free State failing to live up to the promise of the 1916 proclamation. In McGahern’s description of his adolescence in Leitrim, where guards patrolled ‘roads in which nothing happened…beside a phone that never rang’, we can discern a subterranean Irish history, one in which the functioning of the state was remote from people’s everyday lives. McGahern sees Ireland, not as the arms of government, but composed more of people and families, ‘thousands of little republics’. McGahern theorises that this has determined the shape of our literature, that at times when national identity is strong, the novel predominates, whereas when the individual identity is stronger, poems or short stories are the result. Given what he has said about families composing states in their own right, it is clear that McGahern’s sense of national identity, has little to do with Irishness.</p>
<p>At one point,McGahern reflects that while the Catholic church has faded as a fulcrum of Irish life, he’s too old to predict what might take its place. This is a question which Collins’ next film, What We Leave in our Wake takes as its starting point. The film opens on Croagh Patrick at dawn, to the sound of a crowd of people hiking up the rocks along the mountainside. The film begins to deteriorate, as scratches and other cinematographic artefacts appear at the edges of the frame. The nature of the pilgrimage itself is ambiguous, many of the pilgrims wear hiking gear and almost none of them are barefoot, suggesting the pilgrimage may not be strictly religious as a ritual. The crowd negotiating fragments of rock typifies What We Leave in our Wake, an inquiry into Ireland’s transitional state, awaiting the arrival of a new, potentially post-Catholic dispensation. Unlike A Private World, the discussion is dispersed and wide-ranging, taking in a series of historians, writers, authors and scholars who each discuss Irish life and Irish values, over long, lingering shots of rural landscapes. Collins also begins to make use of the archive. From a snippet of a documentary on punitive rehabilitation, we move to a close-up of Father Peter McVerry who speaks about the failure of the state to provide healthcare or economic security to emigrants, heroin addicts and the poor. McVerry then fades away, leaving only his voice, speaking over footage of distressed people on a dock waving goodbye to their relatives. One might think here, of the approach of British documentarian Adam Curtis who also makes use of suggestive footage in addition to his own, specially shot film. Unlike Curtis, however, Collins’ argument is often implicit and functions by subtle juxtaposition, the movement from one topic to another without the subsumption of everything to a polemic of epochal decline.</p>
<p>What We Leave in Our Wakeis far more attentive to the cultural than the economic,and promotes a modern revivalism whereby Ireland’s rich cultural history might remedy its political problems. Declan Kiberd, one of What We Leave in Our Wake’s foremost voices, cites William Butler Yeats, Seamus Heaney and James Joyce as examples of writers whose works have dug into Irish place and history, shaping the future by re-engaging the past. The crowds climbing Croagh Patrick return, with some people moving up and others moving down, the crowd seeming to form a coherent thread in their collective dialectical movement. Desultory speeches from former Taoiseach Brian Cowen about securing the future through austerity budgeting serve as reminders of the post-2008 regime, a time in which public life conceived the future, in variations on ‘there is no alternative’. What We Leave in Our Wake equivocates here, between these impersonal forces of managerialism and the growth of ‘permissiveness’, or individualism, which culminates in some uncharacteristically easy visuals from Collins, with the Celtic Tiger-era spire looming high over the statue of Jim Larkin, or a group of people waiting at traffic lights to cross onto O’Connell bridge (read: ‘the masses’), while a voiceover informs us how bovine and depoliticised they have become.</p>
<p>There is something quite simplistic, too, in What We Leave in our Wake’s cleaving to the ancient past, or the 1916 Proclamation as sources of transformative change, without acknowledging the contradictions of authentic nationality in an Irish context. Indeed, Kiberd’s assertion that Ireland should embody a ‘mixture of forwardness and backwardness’ by providing the unborn and dead with votes, seems to partake far more of the latter than the former. Fortunately, these notions of Irishness come under pressure in Tim Robinson: Connemara. Tim Robinson, the subject of the film, is a cartographer and visual artist who lived for many years in the west of Ireland, writing psychogeographic accounts of the region and tracing local geographies and histories. Robinson begins the film by critiquing Celtic revivalists such as Yeats or John Millington Synge who came to the west of Ireland in order to mediate it for their Dublin audience. Rather than treating the landscape as an abstract Jungian archetype, to be excavated by poets or politicians, Robinson’s Connemara is abject; the story of a man losing his way on the way home from the workhouse and dying from exposure in a storm is emblematic. Collins’ camera is focused on the uneven and rocky terrain, in which Robinson seems diminished, relative to the scale of the landscape, which ‘no single science, not even all the sciences put together, can read’. Despite Robinson’s decades-long attempt to map the area, he believes the wholeness to be artificial: ‘Sometimes, rarely, a scrap of a voice can be caught from the universal damage, but it may be an artefact of the imagination, a confection of rumours’. Collins’ editing begins to ape Robinson’s theoretical mysticism by rapidly interleaving scenes of rural life; a conversation between two men sitting at a Marian grotto, families watching the television, church-going, rowing contests, youth club discos, graveyards, over an ambient soundbed interspersed with inaudible voices, shouting and calling, until all ascends into a voiceless confusion.</p>
<p>Collins’ first feature, Silence opens with a recording artist named Eoghan, travelling from Berlin to his childhood home, in the Irish north-west. In the first hotel he stays in, a bartender tells him about an island off the coast of Scotland, which has been uninhabited for fifty years. However, the starlings on the island have passed the man-made sounds of the island’s former inhabitants from generation to generation. Eoghan is uninterested, explaining that he is trying to record places as far removed from man-made noise as possible. However, the bartender’s anecdote remains troubling. Eoghan is enacting the inverse of folklore collectors travelling west in the early twentieth century, in trying to get away from people and their stories. But if man-made sounds embed and reproduce themselves in the natural world, is it possible to escape them? The Beckettian monologue which is delivered by Patrick O’Connor about the loudness of ancient places and the palimpsestic nature of the Irish landscape, suggests not.</p>
<p>Eoghan is a reticent figure. His conversation with his partner in Berlin is drowned out by a passing train and he often seems uncomfortable in the frame, wandering out of it, leaving the camera to linger on his ambient microphone. Though he rebuffs the bartender talking about starlings, as he moves closer to Tory Island, where he grew up, he begins to engage more with the people he encounters. A local in Ballycroy provides us with the most dialogue-heavy portion of the film, and most of the film’s thematising happens here. Eoghan avoids questions about his family, suggesting of a past he has yet to deal with. After dinner, the man encourages Eoghan to sing ‘The Rocks of Bawn’, but he does not know it. He can recite the verse of another Gaelic song, telling the story of a man who leaves island life for the mainland, only to return years later, to find his lover dead, and the community he once knew changed. It is in this potential loss of tradition in Silence that Collins’ revivalist melancholia re-asserts itself. However, it is asserted with a crucial difference. One section of the film is given over solely to archival footage, in which eight islanders, seven men, one woman and a dog, travel out on a boat. The boat travels out from shore for a while, while one of the men seems to be doing something with a stone and a rope. The dog is then thrown overboard. We see it struggling in place for a while, before the camera cuts back to the boat, and then back to where the dog was, reduced now, to a patch of disturbed grey water, beginning to smooth itself over. It’s a stark and upsetting sequence of images, but also an injunction against the kind of nostalgia that might otherwise hang over archival recordings, a depoliticised hauntology as in Reeling in the Years when film grain seems already to summon up a soundbed of yesteryear’s pop music. Collins’ refusal to present islander life, or the past, as better, or more pious for its remoteness enacts a break with the straightforward revivalism of What We Leave in Our Wake.</p>
<p>After visiting the Inishbofin heritage museum, and speaking to the woman who works there, about the trauma of moving to the mainland, Eoghan travels out into the woods and builds a fire, recording it and himself singing the fragments of the Irish song he remembers. Eoghan seems to have reconciled himself to a fusion between the natural world and human-led encounters, perceiving that one has the capacity to enhance the other. When Eoghan does return to his home on Tory Island, its status as a community is emphasised. People stepping off the boat are embraced by their families, and he has a warm conversation with an older man who remembers from yers ago. His childhood home resounds with man-made sounds, in the form of childhood remembrances and ghosts of the past, the rattle of cutlery, footsteps from upstairs, his mother calling. One thinks here Virginia Woolf’s ‘broken words, inarticulate words, like the shuffling of feet on pavement’. In Silence, the past is an agonistic multiplicity, and not something straightforward enough to just mourn or to be nostalgic for.</p>
<p>Living in a Coded Land is Collins’ second essay film, and considers, the post-colonial nature of lived experience in Ireland. This theme is introduced by Conor Cruise O’Brien, who addresses the camera directly, on the need to formulate a progressive Irish nationalism which breaks from the tradition of violence. Pádraig Lenihan then describes the sheer scale of the carnage at the Battle of the Aughrim in an idyllic farmland where the battle took place over three hundred years ago, interspersed also with footage of Orangemen marches, long funeral escorts and police trucks circling barricades. Collins’ archival quotes are becoming less allegorical and more recognisably argumentative, Living in a Coded Land also has clearer targets, with a digression on the architecture of the Protestant big house, followed by a shot of former Taoiseach Charlie Haughey exiting his own. After this, we see a well dressed assistant county engineer, Keating, descended from the great Irish historian Geoffrey Keating, former owner of the nearby Moorstown Castle, driving down a road in county Tipperary. Keating inspects the work of a local man named Michael Cleary, dressed in work clothes, while a voice chirpily informs us that ‘Michael’s ancestors might easily have worked for him’. One could go on, there are plenty of vignettes through which Collins sketches the vector of modern Irish history through the history of land ownership and capital accumulation. Thomas McCarthy’s contribution provides the film with its title, explaining how the Irish establishment takes shape: ‘those who wish to be part of the establishment soon learn how to live in a kind of coded life, they know what to criticise, they know what to praise…they know when to remain silent’. From these broad heights of four hundred years of modern history, to the most local perspectives possible, with Paddy Heaney talking about depopulation and successive governments failing to install requisite infrastructure in Ballymacadam, Living in a Coded Land is focused on Ireland’s haves and have-nots and how each sustain themselves.</p>
<p>The film’s political analysis is most indebted to historian Conor McCabe, who with help from Seán Ó Faoláin and Heather Laird, describes the growth of the class which has historically directed state policy in Ireland. McCabe refers to them as the ‘comprador class’, arguing that they are present in every colonial regime as the intermediary between foreign capital and state resources. While initially they were large farmers in the midlands who exported capital, in the seventies, they became an urban class of stockbrokers, accountants and lawyers, replicating the pattern of most advanced capitalist states. Fortunately, Collins does pass over Ireland’s comparatively uneven relationship with other non-white settler states such as India, as can be the norm in discussions of Ireland and post-colonialism. This emphasis on exports and dependence on foreign investment rendered Dublin effectively a warehouse port; with no skilled workers or native industry, unskilled labourers were highly expendable to the production process. This outline of our unique precarity, which endures to this day, is outlined while Tony MacMahon plays traditional reels on the accordion for UCD students in the early seventies. Towards the film’s end, we hear the voice of folklorist Henry Glassie, who, in an interview with Vincent Woods, talks about the contextual and historical nature of art. Glassie speaks on the impossibility of bringing a universal vision of judgement and that everything requires interpretation in its own context.</p>
<p>It is a sentiment that exists in a certain degree of tension with Collins’ Song of Granite, a biopic of the folk singer Joe Heaney, though not a biopic in any straightforward sense. There is no attempt to reflect or to create the drama of Heaney’s life, rather it is a film more invested in feeling than biographical details. In addition to using archival footage of Joe Heaney he is played by three separate actors, one for each particular stage of his life. We begin with Joe’s childhood, which subverts in all respects what we might expect from a representation of Irish childhood, particularly one of such acute material deprivation, in Connemara in the twenties. However, the island community seems particularly close-knit, with houses full of people listening to folk tales, his teacher noticing his singing talent, or being taught to catch lobsters with his father. One finds waiting for the moment in which a drunken relative or abusive teacher might hit Joe, but it never comes.</p>
<p>Rather than, as one might expect from conventional biopics, showing Joe getting his first big break, or having addiction problems, the film takes all of Heaney’s life at once as its subject. At one point, Heaney monologues about his place in a sweep of history, from the pre-Christian Partholón, to Newgrange’s construction, to the Mongol hordes to the USSR. This becomes most visible at a fifteen-minute or so section of the film given over to a session in a pub. At this point, Heaney is living in Glasgow with his family as a labourer point in Heaney’s life in which he worked in Glasgow as a labourer in the fifties. Heaney sings ‘The Rocks of Bawn’ alone and then a number of contemporary Irish musicians such as Radie Peat, Damien Dempsey and Lisa O’Neill, perform. After the session is concluded, and after being interviewed by a journalist on the nature of sean-nós singing, Heaney returns to his home in Glasgow. All the singers appear to be playing themselves, which presents the question, is this session happening in Glasgow, or in Dublin where it was shot? Is this whole scene a metaphor for the kind of timeless milieu that folk culture can engender, in which boundaries such as time and space are suspended? As with all art worth considering in detail, the answers to questions such as these are largely immaterial.</p>
<p>In addition to positing his place within a history that is not just Irish, but also universal, the film points to Heaney’s inscrutability as a subject. As the film continues, we witness not Heaney’s spiritual education or musical apprenticeship but his disintegration. We see him working as a doorman, standing attention outside an apartment building in New York, interspersed with archival footage of him performing at the Newport Folk Festival, or walking along a Connemara beach with the Clancy Brothers. When we return to New York, it is the Connemara waves, rather than the sounds of the urban environment which predominates. Joe does seem to return home to Connemara at the end of the film, specifically to a field in which we witnessed him tie a piece of string around a tuft of grass next to a bird’s nest the film’s first scene. Fifty years later the string has remained, and the eggs have hatched, leaving only their fragments. This is obviously unlikely, so the eggs more likely to serve as symbols of maturity and renewal. Heaney then encounters his younger self and the milieu is transformed once more, as his younger self becomes Finn MacCool, meeting his older self, and re-enacting the salmon of knowledge myth. At Song of Granite’s conclusion, folklore and reality have become wholly intertwined.</p>
<p>Song of Graniteconcludes with a hand, writing in Irish, in reference to a man mentioned earlier in the film who confesses his sins on his deathbed through a poem on his bedroom wall. The words, translated, appear as follows:</p>
<p>*Birds don’t sing songs of glory,</p>
<p>wings of ice,</p>
<p>that’s my story.*</p>
<p>While recognising that Song of Granite is not be Collins’ last film, there is a certain appositeness to regarding these lines as a summation of his work to date. Collins’ is a filmmaker attentive to loss; failed states, fading traditions, faltering lives, but does not give in, either to despair or pretension. His concerned with lived experiences, even as they pose probing and resonant queries about ourselves and the future of our country. There’s no one else making films like his; they are worth your time.</p>

			<title>What is George Eliot&#39;s &#39;Middlemarch&#39;?</title>

			<description>Anne Enright once said that every novel could, with minimal damage, be re-titled as Person Gets it Wrong. It is a gesture that would well serve George Eliot’s Middlemarch, as it is a novel primarily concerned with bringing even the most marginal of its characters’ ideals into collision with discommoding contingency. Although, it leaves us with the problem as to what to do with the subtitle, A Study of Provincial Life.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anne Enright once said that every novel could, with minimal damage, be re-titled as Person Gets it Wrong. It is a gesture that would well serve George Eliot’s Middlemarch, as it is a novel primarily concerned with bringing even the most marginal of its characters’ ideals into collision with discommoding contingency. Although, it leaves us with the problem as to what to do with the subtitle, A Study of Provincial Life. There are a number of ways we could interpret this phrase, it could imply the narrator’s tendency to treat society empirically, as though it were one of Mr. Farebrother’s specimens beneath Mr. Lydgate’s microscope, according to the maxim that tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner. Before that though, it might be productive to consider the narrator herself.</p>
<p>The narrator is mostly sympathetic (‘I am sorry to add that she was crying’), though sometimes disapproving (‘apt to be a little severe towards her own sex’), often didactic (‘do not imagine’) and self-conscious; she reprimands herself for beginning a chapter from Dorothea’s perspective before taking Casaubon’s as a means of compensating. Who exactly is speaking at any given time can be difficult to pin down exactly, as she will often interleave the characters’ thoughts (‘mouldy futilities’, ‘insects’) with her own, more objective rendering of the situation. From when she speaks is also not without complication, as she seems to speak out of a foreknowledge as to which memories which will stay with characters for the rest of their lives. Although, a lot of these questions may be left by the by; the long, long sentences in which she writes, which tease out situations from almost every conceivable point of view according to breathtakingly elaborate analogies the nuances of which seem honed to the most minute details give Middlemarch its best moments. Feng and Hirst have written that the difference between a naturalist’s free indirect discourse and that of a modernist is that the former preserves grammatical coherence, so that the precise junctures at which one register slips in under the other can always be precisely detected. This is not a perfect definition, but we are less interested in prodding paragraphs until they rupture, and more in how the narrator’s methodology subverts itself in broader terms.</p>
<p>At one point, the narrator describes how her task is somewhat limited in its scope: ‘that light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe’. This universe which forms Middlemarch’s backdrop, is in the year 1829–1831, a period which witnessed a wide range of labour agitation in the form of mass demonstations and loom breaking; demonstrations of over 100,000 took place in Birmingham and London. Though drawing a single disposition across all those involved in these events would be quite impossible, one symptom of its cause, and certainly that aspect of it which had the closest approximation to broad range of support across all classes, was a push to extend the franchise to the more of England’s population. However, according to E.P. Thompson, those most public leaders tended to damp down the demands of the more radical artisans and other skilled or semi-skilled working men. This, in conjunction with the counter-revolutionaries of the time scared into action by events in France, was effective in quashing the most radical aspects of this movement.</p>
<p>Given this capacity to move between time and space, the narrator’s attention is strangely limited to that of individuals, and individuals who own land at that. Although, to be fair, Middlemarch takes place in a fictionalised version of Coventry, far from the industrial centres of the north such as Manchester or Birmingham. In The Making of the English Working Class,E.P. Thompson mentions that in Coventry, skilled labourers would have been ribbon-weavers and were often semi-unemployed. We may add to this, from what we see in the novel, a substantial rural labouring underclass of unskilled workers, and tanners, who we see disrupting Mr. Brooke’s liberal, reform-based speech when he stands for election. Apart from Mr. Brooke’s obvious discomfort amongst the working men, this crisis in labour remains muted in Middlemarch, manifesting itself in brief references to the Vincys being slightly harder up financially than they were expecting.</p>
<p>There are two exceptions to the narrator’s myopia, but they are likewise revealing. One, is in the form of an encounter with Dagley, a labourer with a small, neglected holding on Mr. Brooke’s land. Mr. Brooke requests that he keep his son’s dog under control as it is interfering with his coursing but Dagley is drunk, says he will not, and makes a number of warnings about the changes the voting reform bill will bring. The narrator explains Dagley’s behaviour by referring to his having engaged in ‘muddy political talk’ which can render the labouring poor idle and resistant to change. His education, here seems to have rendered him more ignorant. The second, is a group of harassing a number of railway agents. Mr. Garth, a local labourer surveying the area, chases after the men, threatening to report them to the magistrate, then tries to convince them how incorrect they are to oppose the railway. One among them, Timothy Cooper, provides the most articulate defense against the installation of the line, although, in a very thick dialect, descending to almost Elizabeth Gaskell levels of didacticism. The narrator furthermore describes Cooper as ‘having as little of the feudal spirit, and believing as little, as if he had not been totally unacquainted with the Age of Reason and the Rights of Man’. Thomas Paine’s books and other pamphlets were incidentally banned and in many areas, the police enacted violent reprisals on those who sold or disseminated his writings. This weighting the scales is all the more surprising considering how sympathetic or humanist Middlemarch is elsewhere. So sympathetic is the narrator, that we are in effect expressly forbidden from feelinging negatively towards Casaubon; for every paragraph explicating Dorothea’s anguish, we get Casubon’s sense of being peripheral to intellectual (‘unvenerated’) and social (‘unloved’) life. That these references to the labourers are demonstrative of a deeper conservatism, may be attested to by the narrator’s early summing up of the medical profession at the time: ‘disease in general was called by some bad name, and treated accordingly…as if, for example, it were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on with blank cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once’. The brutality of counter-revolution at the time in which Middlemarch is set, not just at the infamous Battle of Peterloo, but also by police forces at various local levels sounds a rather sadistic and bloodthirsty note in the text, which shows up, I think, the limits of this emphasis on sympathetic narration.</p>
<p>Frederic Jameson writes of the realist novel as existing in a dialectical tension with its antecedent, the romance. While the novel in the mid to late ninteenth century might claim to see and to represent ‘the world as it is’, it remains partially dependent on the mechanics of the romance plot; techniques such as coincidences, letters and wills. John Raffles appears to me as one such throwback, a return of the Gothic repressed, his murder only partially re-constituted within the naturalistic novel’s machine by being plausibly deniable, due to intentional negligence with prescribed opiates, and accompanied by a transfer of capital which will redeem Lydate from bankruptcy. It is not revolution or reform that changes a community, rather the steady circulation of gossip through the rural community.</p>
<p>Without bringing any statistical reading to bear on Middlemarch I noticed on my reading a sequence of words which seemed to attach themselves to particular character. For Dorothea, it was ‘ardent’, for Rosamund, ‘neck’. For the workers, the incorrigible symptoms of inequality, it is ‘ignorance’, one which occurs in each of the instances mentioned above, as well as references to the social life at The Tankard on Slaughter Lane, the metonymic device by which the low life of Middlemarch is gestured towards, and I would so very much like to read a Middlemarch that did not feel the need to lean on these three words quite so often as it does.</p>

			<description>The first thing one notices about Joanna Walsh’s online novella Seed is the quality of the design. Seed’s aesthetic is very consistent, and was obviously designed with an eye to the material at hand. For all this we have its illustrator Charlotte Hicks to thank, as well as the digital publishing company responsible for designing the platform on which the text is hosted. Seed is optimised for iOS, and, as the site tells us, is probably better viewed there, but it can also be read on a laptop or a PC.</description>

Seed’s aesthetic is very consistent, and was obviously designed with an eye to the material at hand. For all this we have its illustrator Charlotte Hicks to thank, as well as the digital publishing company responsible for designing the platform on which the text is hosted. Seed is optimised for iOS, and, as the site tells us, is probably better viewed there, but it can also be read on a laptop or a PC.</p>
<p>The reader begins by being presented with seventeen different plants which open up onto different lexia, with suggestive and minimalistic titles such as ‘Baby’, ‘Touch’ or ‘Red’. Each one gives a brief insight into the life of an eighteen year old woman living in a middle-class housing estate in suburban England, coming to terms with herself, her environment, the people around her and the reality of her incipient young adulthood. By presenting the reader with seventeen different starting points (ignoring the opening explanatory remarks for a moment), and the means of proceeding in any way they might choose, the text emulates the same provisional and tentative steps that the narrator concurrently takes in the development of her own identity. In an interview, Walsh explains that the rhizoidal orientation of the text provided her with the opportunity to disorientate the reader, and perhaps engender in them the same uncertainty that the protagonist of the novella may be feeling at any given time, so that the reader has:</p>
<p><em>no sense of reading left to right, of the weight of the book, of how far they were through, or, sometimes, of the direction within the narrative.</em></p>
<p>Seed is therefore doing very deliberate and self-conscious things with the particularities of its format, typical of texts which, overtly or otherwise, draw attention to their digitality. Insofar as a firm distinction can be drawn between these two facets of the work, Seed therefore introduces a coherence/tension between its form and its content.</p>
<p>In a design quirk which enables this sense of openness that Seed conveys, the reader has the option of changing the text’s visual interface in order to display differently-coloured vines intertwined between each of the plants. The colours refer to each lexia’s subject matter, and inverts the standardised and industrial nature of colour-coding, a tendency, or obssession, that the narrator exhibits throughout the text:</p>
<p><em>Fruits in the supermarket. They’re a different species. Those strawberries all white in the middle all the year round, like crunchy peaches. Everything so shiny. Not a speck of earth anywhere. Why would there be? It goes straight from the formica shed to our formica kitchen. Once cut my mother wraps it in cling film and puts it in the fridge.</em></p>
<p>The narrator’s sustained attention to post-industrial artefacts, the symptoms of contemporary, or then-contemporary suburban living, is the strongest aspect of Seed. The narrator’s oscillation between a tone of matter-of-fact inventory and syntax-rupturing anxiety, enacts the very process of interpretation and the fact that so much narrative time is deployed in coming to terms with such quotidian objects, made to seem strange by their presence in a narrative medium known for attention to other, less strange things, intensifies the effect:</p>
<p><em>The doves in our garden say something else no they say somewhere else from their tall perspective looking down on lawns mowed with stripes, somewhere nature isn’t the same kind we have round here.</em></p>
<p>The site’s drawing together of Seed’s structure and content, finds a corollary in the text’s actual word usage. Walsh uses leitmotifs, particularly the names of plants or descriptions of colours in order to string each unit of text together with one another in more subtle ways, without making use of an overt visual interface.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the text is not as radically discontinuous as it might at first seem, or certainly was not regarded as such by Walsh, who said the following in an interview:</p>
<p><em>I’ve been thinking about the authority I’m still claiming as an ‘author’ in Seed; despite the degree of reader-control offered by the project, it’s still a fairly traditional ‘authorial’ work.</em></p>
<p><em>I had to write Seed as a linear text to ensure it will read ok for anyone who wants to follow the temporal narrative. That said, I never write in a ‘linear’ fashion, but in one that resembles the Seed reading experience: I write phrases, notes, paragraphs, then brings them together on shuffle, until they work.</em></p>
<p>Walsh’s comments may be surprising for those familiar with her writing methodology, which involves the use of cut-ups, or other aleatoric methods which introduce an element of chance into the composition process. It is surprising also, for those who are familiar with the somewhat niche history of digital or hypertextual literature. For many of hypertext’s trailblazing practitioners, such as Shelley Jackson or Michael Joyce, the crux of hypertextual literature was the game-playing that new digital formats allowed the author to engage in as an absent centre of meaning, which expedited the then-extremely trendy dalliances with post-structuralist philosophy and critical theory in a digital context. Within Seed’s units of text after all, there is no opportunity for interaction, except insofar as the text requires you to turn the page. In an interview with Review31, Walsh described how Seed barely resembles a hypertext in the original sense of the term at all, and that it is much better understood as a traditional work focalised around the author’s vision.</p>
<p>This is true, firstly for the structural reasons already outlined, but also because Seed’s formal architecture is best understood as functioning in the same way as literary works in print do, in that they imply, or gesture, far more readily than they state directly. This is axiomatic for all novels worthy of the name, but it presents an interesting means of thinking about how narrative works in the context of Seed in particular. While it might seem to present some amount of freedom or capacity for interaction, Seed is in fact circumscribing you even as it offers the chance of liberation. This has a nice visual metaphor in Seed’s visual interface which deliberately places a number of other flowers beyond the reader’s reach in darkness, suggesting both the thwarted ambition to move beyond the text that we’re presented with, and, as I’ve said already, the myopia of the narrator in her own environment:</p>
<p><em>it’s a fairly tight work, and I’ve said what I wanted to say in it. I love the idea of locked passages: part of my intent was to create a feeling of implied space beyond what is described (isn’t that the intent of most novels, to create, in however abstract a sense, a ‘world’, even if ‘world’ means a set of conceptual parameters?). I’d like to do a print edition to see if and how the circle of nonlinearity could be squared.</em></p>
<p>Though we have the ability to read Seed in any order we might like, each section is up to five pages long, and therefore requires us to read chronologically for a far greater length of time than hypertexts of the nineties do. Whether this can be attributed to the now mainstream nature of micro-textual formats, which requires literature to aspire to something else is probably a question for others to answer. Personally speaking, if writers working digitally can produce works as good as Seed, I won’t be unduly detained by the sociological reasonings why.</p>

			<title>Chris Morris&#39; Blue Jam Monologues</title>

			<description>Chris Morris’ television show Jam was originally a radio series called Blue Jam, in which five to ten minute ‘sketches’ played out above an ambient soundtrack bed. When it was imported to television, the actors lip-synced to these pre-recordings, intensifying the surreal effect that the show gave off. Jam is subversive, hilarious, absurd and if you’ve never seen it, I’d advise you to keep it that way.

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chris Morris’ television show Jam was originally a radio series called Blue Jam, in which five to ten minute ‘sketches’ played out above an ambient soundtrack bed. When it was imported to television, the actors lip-synced to these pre-recordings, intensifying the surreal effect that the show gave off. Jam is subversive, hilarious, absurd and if you’ve never seen it, I’d advise you to keep it that way. Every episode contains at least one thing that is one of the worst things I’ve ever seen, let alone the worst thing I’ve ever seen in show that it supposedly a comedy. In one episode, a couple are only slightly irritated that their child has been abducted and murdered, in another, a woman near fatally maims a cyclist in order to have someone to talk to, and in one of the show’s legendarily creepy cold openings, a homeless man is abducted and forced to wrestle pigs for sport. These are some of the milder scenarios of the show’s one-season run.</p>
<p>One of the running sketches that appears in Blue Jam never made the transition into the television show, one in which an unnamed character relates a narrative in monologue. Based on the addictions he outlines, he seems to have a neurological disorder of some kind. We only get snatches of his backstory; his narratives are far too fragmented to provide any specific detail. We might get some bits of information regarding the narrator’s wife and his childhood, but this isn’t to say that can necessarily trust what it is that he says; take this example:</p>
<p><em>I began to remember the time when I was seven and a gerbil had started swearing at me. Amongst other things it had told me that my dad was having an affair. I told my mum and soon afterwards the family had split up.</em></p>
<p>While none of these sketches made it into the television show, one of the monologues, in which the narrator is goaded by a talking dog, supposedly acting as his lawyer, goads him into doing various things, was adopted into a short film My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117 in 2002, starring Paddy Considine. It’s not quite successful however, the original medium in which these sketches appeared, discontinuous monologues within the context of a radio sketch show, are definitely more suited to rendering them. The short film brings the viewer too close to the psychosis by representing the dog as actually talking, and loses the overall effect of having the listener dependent on the narrator’s perspective, however unreliable. Added to all this, it isn’t really one of the best monologues, one has the feeling that the joke is going on for too long.</p>
<p>The most successful pieces are the ones rooted within social comedy while maintaining the surrealist vibe, in such a way that is reminiscent of Samuel Beckett or Flann O’Brien, which has had I think, a far greater impact on UK/Irish comedy than is generally acknowledged. Compare the fundamental uncertainty touched upon in these monologues with the opening of Beckett’s novel Molloy:</p>
<p><em>I am in my mother’s room. It’s I who live there now. I don’t know how I got there. Perhaps in an ambulance, certainly a vehicle of some kind. I was helped. I’d never have got there alone. There’s this man who comes every week. Perhaps I got there thanks to him. He says not.</em></p>
<p>with the third episode:</p>
<p><em>I had been in the pub three hours talking to a guy I used to work with named Ian before I realised he wasn’t called Ian at all and I was in the wrong pub. By that stage he was very cross. He poked me in the chest and asked me if I was some kind of puppy squeezer.</em></p>
<p>And another one because it’s rather good:</p>
<p><em>I had wandered into a children’s park under the influence of Prozac and I had beaten up an ostrich while several toddlers looked on and cried…I begged a little girl to kill me. She left with her mother shortly afterwards.</em></p>
<p>It is in the second instalment of the show that the target of Morris’ satire becomes a bit clearer, as the narrator is mistaken for a piece of conceptual art after he goes blind. His blindness is a side-effect of his codeine overdose, it should be noted. Morris is clearly taking aim at 1990’s Britain, and the growth of ‘Cool Britannia,’ not to mention the urban chattering classes who propagate it. In this New Labour era, almost every character the narrator encounters is more a bundle of shallow affectations than a real person; when he is exhibited in an apartment, they are reported as saying things like: ‘this is what art should be. Moving in a relevant way.’ Novelist Will Self even makes a cameo, declaring that he ‘has never seen a more kleptomasturbatory entropoid.’ One can imagine Morris, an increasingly feted, critical darling in this media landscape of this era, casting an eye on his peers who lacked his critical eye regarding the media establishment.</p>
<p>In another, he meets a comedian named Tony at a party, ‘standing next to a huge ice sculpture of his head.’ One thinks of David Baddiel and Rob Newman playing Wembley Stadium, and the belief that British comedy in the nineties was to be ‘the new rock n’ roll’. Merely by being in attendance, the speaker’s career seems to be getting off to a good start:</p>
<p><em>By the time I got back to the crab tartlets, I had an agent, a transmittable pilot, a five year development deal and someone with a mobile phone told me Jarvis Cocker wanted to meet with me.</em></p>
<p>The highlight for me, is probably ‘The Suicide Journalist,’ in which a journalist named Clive has announced in his weekly column, his intention to commit suicide, and to document process over a number of weeks. The column is a big hit among the bright young things, who all attempt to impress Clive at a dinner party with tales of their own mental anguish and self-harm: ‘Look at my scars. They are beautiful, but not as beautiful as your columns.’</p>
<p>Goby Jovler (in theory rather than execution) is another probable highlight, as a parody of a vapid Pinter imitation, responsible for a play called Fuckers: ‘critics had said it was the devastatingly accurate play that will ever be written about sex,’ which tackles the subject of urban alienation ‘as a sexual malfunctioning zeitgeist.’</p>
<p>It’s worth reflecting on these sorts of media edifices Morris satirises in amidst the nineties nostalgia arising in our current era of political turmoil, and remembering that, while they might have been a good time for journalists and cocaine users (significant overlap here) they weren’t a golden age of affluence for everyone. The seemingly homeless, indigent and drug-addicted narrator is probably not there are a means of furthering the show’s social critique, but serves as a disembodied presence through which the era, in all of its absurdity, becomes clear. He’s at his best when used as a foil to the absurd commentariat, as in the quotation below:</p>
<p><em>I said I’d had no money for a bottle of wine and the homeless bloke at the tube station who usually subs me a couple of quid because he says I look worse off than his dog was being mugged when I’d asked him this time, and hadn’t given me a penny. And then I’d got lost because I’d forgotten whether Susie’s house was opposite some trees or opposite no trees at all. Several conversations had started by the time I’d got to that bit.</em></p>

			<description>As has been repeated in any number of the literary outlets which give Will Self column inches, Self has thumbed his nose at the British literary establishment, readers and writers alike, by returning to the ground zero of avant-garde prose writing in his trilogy of Umbrella, Shark and the forthcoming Phone. I held off reading Umbrella for some time, for the same reason that one generally doesn’t read a novel written by one of the authors that one might rate highly, sensing in advance that it will be in some way a disappointment, particularly when said author has set themselves the task of re-invigorating an dormant genre in which one is steeped in, on a semi-professional basis.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As has been repeated in any number of the literary outlets which give Will Self column inches, Self has thumbed his nose at the British literary establishment, readers and writers alike, by returning to the ground zero of avant-garde prose writing in his trilogy of Umbrella, Shark and the forthcoming Phone. I held off reading Umbrella for some time, for the same reason that one generally doesn’t read a novel written by one of the authors that one might rate highly, sensing in advance that it will be in some way a disappointment, particularly when said author has set themselves the task of re-invigorating an dormant genre in which one is steeped in, on a semi-professional basis.</p>
<p>But I did listen to, and read, an awful lot of interviews in which Self spoke on why he’s returning to modernism as a wellspring for his own fiction. In one of these interviews, which unfortunately, I can’t seem to find, Self says that one of the things he was trying to avoid, was writing a post-modern version of modernity. At the time I heard it, I had no idea what that might mean, or what a post-modern modernity might look like. After having read Umbrella, whether Self intended it or not, I have a far better understanding of the phrase, because I think that a post-modern modernity is exactly what Self has stumbled upon in Umbrella.</p>
<p>The plot moves between roughly three time frames, centred around four individuals, the primary one being Zack Busner, a fixture in many of Self’s works, Busner generally functions as a composite of the author and the late neurologist Oliver Sacks. In Umbrella, Busner is a psychiatrist based in London, treating Audrey Death for her encephalitic lethargica, which has left her in a catatonic state for decades. In some parts of the novel, Busner is doing so in 1970, and in other parts, he looks back on the affair in 2010. While this is happening, the narrative will jump back to the Audrey’s early adulthood in the opening decades of the century, working in a munitions factory, getting involved in radical socialist circles. Her brothers, Stanley and Albert, are also focalisers of the narrative at points, albeit in very different ways. Indirect discourse and interior monologue are probably the two best known characteristics of modernist prose, and these two take the lion’s share of the novel’s foray into experimentation, allowing for the character’s voices to blend suggestively with the narrator’s, making it difficult to tell where Audrey, Busner, Albert and Stanley are speaking amidst the barrage of music-hall pieces, street rhymes and song lyrics. Side Note: Azaelia Banks and The Kinks feature. Unfortunately, Self generally does so through use of italics. Here’s a typical example:</p>
<p>The boyfriend hadn’t minded gotta split, man and Busner was split…a forked thing digging its way inside her robe. She fiddled with bone buttons at her velvety throat. His skin and hairs snagged on the mirrors, his fingers did their best with her nipples. She looked down on me from below … one his calves lay cold on the floorboards. There was the faint applause of pigeons from outside the window —</p>
<p>Italics are used here to allow us access to Busner’s mind, his memory, and for Lear references. There’s nothing bad in here (or in the novel overall, Self’s sentences are staggering for how rhymically attuned they are, particularly when he dallies with academic verbiage and sub-clauses to the extent that he does), the problem is you sort of know where these turns are coming from the typography. There was a ‘Remastered’ version of Ulysses published about six years ago, produced by Robert Gogan, in which the interior monologue appeared in italics. The three or four people in the world who care about such things were outraged at the simplification, seeing the text as having been purged of its ambiguity. I think this periodic italicisation is to Umbrella’s detriment overall; it substitutes a reading that might have demanded even more of you for a more surreal-looking typeface.</p>
<p>My own notion of Umbrella’s modernism would therefore be rather distinct from the identification made between Umbrella and this rather inflexible and monolithic modernism made in some literary journalism, because I don’t see it as modernist in the same way that the ‘men of 1914’ are modernists. Although they might have one thing in common.</p>
<p>will-self-1420801432</p>
<p>Self’s modernism is a selling point serving a rather specific function in today’s literary marketplace. Self’s modernism builds upon his persona as a surly performer on television news-panel shows and newspaper columns, going out of his way to discourage people from reading his books by his performative hauteur and dismissive attitude regarding everything. Returning to a praxis of literary art some six decades out of date is the logical conclusion of being Will Self. For Self, being a latter day modernist is to reject the commodification of the literary artwork, and insist upon the right of the author to write something wholly non-commercial. Umbrella therefore carries with it a critique of commodity culture, and the proliferation of screens, which Self also decries regularly, believing it to signal an end to the novel. However, the canard of modernism’s opposition to commodity culture has been overhyped after postmodern novelists made such a point of engaging with the novel as a commodity, and one should remember that modernism was deeply involved in the marketplace of its time; Ezra Pound began using zeitgeist-y words like ‘modern’ and ‘futurity’ to draw Marinetti’s audiences, who were substantially larger than his own when he first came to London. Performative modernism, cultivated for the purchasing attentions of a well-groomed and discerning élite is one of the things that Self gets right regarding his channeling of the genre.</p>
<p>Umbrella also seems to draw on modernism’s sometimes overlooked heritage, as it is at least somewhat to blame for the volume of secondary literature written subsequent to its boom and bust. From even a vague knowledge of these texts we might produce some foundational aspects of modernism; that it is taken to entail a shift in consciousness and human subjectivity, that exposure to slaughter and death on an industrial scale led to an ambivalence regarding technology and a sundering of rigid social hierarchies, an increasing mediation of our reality through mass media, growth of radical political movements such as feminism and socialism, etc. etc. etc. Our responses to these texts are thereby pre-determined; we know what we can expect from a canonical modernist text.</p>
<p>Which is why the modernism of Umbrella seems post-modern. It’s hard to read Audrey’s re-animation in the 1970’s, or Busner’s recollection of the time in 2010, as a meta-commentary on Umbrella’s resuscitation of the genre. The fact that Audrey worked in a munitions factory, as a radical socialist and feminist, that one of her brothers, Stanley, went to fight in the war, while her other brother, Albert, Pynchon-like, became an arms manufacturer selling weapons which fuelled the conflict, that in her comatose state she rehearses the actions of her time at the lathe, seems to have been dictated by our relationship to modernism in our contemporary setting. In the novel’s closing stages, Audrey’s status as a symbol of technology’s encroachment into our subjectivity is made overt:</p>
<p>The final words Audrey Death had spoken before relapsing into a merciful swoon were a string of nonsensical fractions — eighteen over four-point-two, ninety-four over fourteen-point-seven, sixty-six-point-three over thirty-three…that, even as he accepted the futility of the exercise, Busner had tried to fit into some conceptual framework. Were they, perhaps, the numerical analogue of her brain-chemistry’s intro-conversions between the discrete and the continuous, the quantifiable and the relativistic?</p>
<p>The irony here is that the paragraph in which Self is telling you exactly what the novel is about, features a character attempting to make sense of a random string of numbers. This is far from what the book is, a novel which has been compulsively over-determined in any number of columns, interviews and lectures which, taken collectively, probably come to a length equal to the text. While the modernists can be considered guilty of pushing particular interpretations — they often wrote about their own work, in the way that authors often do, by pretending to write objectively on other authors, The Waste Land came with annotations (parodic ones, but annotations nonetheless) — it feels as though Self’s foray into it is too overtly packaged as such. It’s probably my own fault for consuming it as I did, a book has to be sold after all, and no one made me read those six Guardian interviews. I should wrap up by saying that this novel is very good, and that you should read it, and, in true modernist style, ‘the rest is noise’.</p>

			<description>I’ve been a fan of Dylan Moran’s stand-up for as far back as I can remember, since I saw his first stand-up special Monster. I think I was about twelve, and Moran’s misanthropic and depressive whimsy got lodged deep into my world view, and influenced me to try stand-up the few times that I did, aswell as slur the way I speak infinitesimally. I’m not sure if the way I speak now is my actual voice.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a fan of Dylan Moran’s stand-up for as far back as I can remember, since I saw his first stand-up special Monster. I think I was about twelve, and Moran’s misanthropic and depressive whimsy got lodged deep into my world view, and influenced me to try stand-up the few times that I did, aswell as slur the way I speak infinitesimally. I’m not sure if the way I speak now is my actual voice. I would obsessively Google clips in the hopes of finding bootleg gigs, as Moran has always been quite good modifying and improvising local and topical material unlikely to turn up in his one-hour specials, the best example of which is his commentary on the 2011 Irish presidential election in Roísin Dubh, Galway.</p>
<p>It was during one of these excursions into the vortex of ‘Related Videos’ that I turned up a radio play that Moran wrote for the BBC, entitled ‘The Expedition,’ in which the protagonist, Aidan Clarke, addressed his absent girlfriend Isabel, in a series of recordings. Their relationship seems to be reaching a breaking point, but nevertheless, Aidan updates Isabel on his progress on a hike with her brother Leonard, though, in the same manner of Eminem’s ‘Stan,’ it is uncertain how the protagonist will get the recordings will make it to her, and why also, he renders them episodically, if it is the case that he will play all of them to her when he returns from his hike.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if Moran didn’t have the drama of Samuel Beckett in mind here. The most obvious parallel is his 1958 play Krapp’s Last Tape, in which an ageing man, apparently a writer, pores over a directory of recordings that he has made on every one of his birthdays, and makes a new one. Rather than dwelling on the details which his young self imparts with most fervour, his aesthetic realisations about life, love, art and all that, Krapp is most interested in returning to recollections of his bygone sexual conquests. Krapp’s Last Tape is far more engaged with the medium in which the recordings are contained than Moran is; the only signal we have that what we are listening to is the imprint of a magnetic field is the click-click noise that each monologue begins with.</p>
<p>Like Krapp’s Last Tape, however, it does chart the decline of its protagonist, from getting nippy and passive aggressive with his partner to succumbing to psychosis and delusion in the play’s second half. Albeit psychosis with comedic intent. It is in these sections that the whimsy that characterises Moran’s act enters the play, the marrying of surreal situations, such encountering a camel in a blizzard on a mountain, with the quotidian experience of being a tourist out of water, trying to amiably make chat with a local. His increasingly choppy and erratic syntax, as well as his estrangement from conventionally expressed emotion may well recall Beckett’s later, scatty prose works: ’I want to say that I want to go home, the wind. The wind.’</p>
<p>It is a cliché generally observed in Irish comedy journalism that such acts driven by their loquaciousness and absurdist perspectives be compared to Flann O’Brien, in who’s writing we see similar things. And this is fine, Moran probably read him and I think Tommy Tiernan is a fan, but it ignores the fundamental aspect of stand-up, and what makes it a form worth discussing on its own terms; the performative element.</p>
<p>Moran’s comedy is primarily character-based; we respond to his material in ways that if another, more Apollo Theatre type stand-up were to make them, we wouldn’t, because he is, in a very short period of time, capable of conveying to an audience what kind of comedian he is. His coming onstage stage in Monster for example features a glass of wine, extravagant arm gestures, a half-hearted audience greeting, and a spot of bother with the mic stand.</p>
<p>Screen Shot 2016-08-15 at 19.01.08</p>
<p>This affectation of partial incompetence or world-weariness is what makes his observations on boozing and drugs in his first special, and his take on family life in his second and those thereafter so good. In the former we see that he’s probably the type to have partaken his fair share of intoxicants. In the second, the absurdity is compacted, as he hasn’t quite shaken off the image of the perpetually drunk sexily dishevelled raconteur. In saying so, I don’t demean character-based stand-up. Stand-up, as traditionally practiced, requires repetition of material, glossed with the illusion of spontaneity.</p>
<p>Flann O’Brien is a very different creature. I’ve sometimes been at odds with his current critical reputation, which seems to me to depend more on his columns than his novels, The Third Policeman, At-Swim-Two-Birds and An Béal Bocht. Seeing him as an anticipator of contemporary Irish stand-up seems to miss how withdrawn he is as an author from his work, how hermetic and alienating his writing style is. In The Third Policeman for example, the bicycles seem more animated than the allegedly human characters, who barely seem to have advanced beyond the sentience of Syngean automata. Fintan O’Toole has spoken well on this peculiar sense of rootlessness in O’Brien’s writing, and wondered how it is possible for such an archetypal postmodern stylist to emerge from a society which hadn’t quite entered modernity yet.</p>
<p>This impersonal note sounded in O’Brien’s fiction is almost antithetical to the notion of comedy as practiced by Moran, who’s stage persona manages to be vital, even when channeling Beckett.</p>

			<description>I really like Arts Tonight on RTÉ. Its quiet pace, insider baseball language and uncompromising commitment to taking a deliberate, intellectual approach to the arts would be easy to parody, but because of its informativeness and tendency to source academics for its panels, it is among the best arts programmes in radio, and I mean the best from both RTÉ and the BBC. I find that the BBC, In Our Time aside, too often goes in for either Today Programme ebullience, in demanding straightforward-one-word, no-nonsense answers to weighty abstract questions or a whimsically boisterous tone, in pursuit of an imagined layman.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like Arts Tonight on RTÉ. Its quiet pace, insider baseball language and uncompromising commitment to taking a deliberate, intellectual approach to the arts would be easy to parody, but because of its informativeness and tendency to source academics for its panels, it is among the best arts programmes in radio, and I mean the best from both RTÉ and the BBC. I find that the BBC, In Our Time aside, too often goes in for either Today Programme ebullience, in demanding straightforward-one-word, no-nonsense answers to weighty abstract questions or a whimsically boisterous tone, in pursuit of an imagined layman. It is sadly the case that it may be the among the only remaining serious arts programme left on the radio.</p>
<p>On a recent episode, on the subject of a book taking a retrospective view on five hundred years of Irish sculpture, Vincent Woods spoke on a particular work he once saw. What seems to have made this piece distinctive for Woods was its temporary nature and this allowed him to strike a personal note, which is welcome, and definitely rare in a programme that wears its occasional staidness with pride. Woods described ‘a sculpture trail in Achill, I think it was in 1996…I was lucky enough to see it and I’ll never forget, even some of the sounds, the sound of a cement mixer in an abandoned concrete house on the Edgewood Cliff…and a series of mirrors on Corrie Lake which just sat like petals, floating on the water…those sorts of images stay.’</p>
<p>Woods’ comments made me think of my own relationship with art that engages with its spatial component to such an extent that it often can’t be replicated elsewhere, or at least without inducing a logistical nightmare, such as site-specific or public art. I can always pick up a Yeats poem that made me feel something, or recall a sentence in The Green Road that makes something cold break over my spine and disseminate itself in my nerves, but I can’t summon up the way that Owen Roe reads an Oscar Wilde story, or Barry McGovern performs Beckett. Installation has that effect too, perhaps accentuated because of my relative ignorance when it comes to contemporary art in general, which may be an asset, because I haven’t yet lost that sense of challenge that confronts one when standing in a space with a thing that has a mass, that one has to mobilise oneself around, perhaps through, in order to grapple with it adequately.</p>
<p>With this in mind, around this time ten years ago I went to IMMA, and saw an installation that I’ve probably been thinking about ever since. The installation occupied one of the many white, airy rooms in the museum and it was on this occasion, that it was sparsely adorned and contained only a vintage-seeming radio, perched on a makeshift metal platform. One of the corners of the room was spray-painted black.</p>
<p>The installation was Black brain radio, and in a wider sense, beyond the confines of the room, it was a sequence of audio pieces recorded, collated and arranged by the artist Garrett Phelan. The pieces were broadcast for about thirty days in early 2006 on the 89.9 FM frequency and touched on topics as varied as the presidency of George W. Bush, the evolution/creationism debate and self-actualisation, albeit in each case, very obliquely. Phelan recorded himself reading reams of material from newspapers, books, or transcribed conversations from commercial radio. However, Phelan didn’t inflect his speech to suit what it was that he was reading, nor did he ‘produce’ his recording in the usual sense. His recordings were no-frills, highlighted by time he took to cough, yawn into the microphone or stop in the middle of a sentence.</p>
<p>I listened to it constantly for as long as it was broadcast, struck primarily by its strangeness and motivated by some desire to understand what the broadcast was adding up to. I think I knew it was mostly nonsense, or too fragmentary to be a whole, but I didn’t realise the extent of its aleatory qualities at the time. Phelan had cut his recordings into two-minute chunks, and randomised the broadcast on an MP3 player, so whatever sequentiality Black brain radio developed was always accidental, always provisional.</p>
<p>Since becoming conscious of how possible it is to purchase just about anything on the internet, I’ve been searching for some hard copy of Black brain radio, and I was thrilled to eventually find it on Discogs; a guy in Holland owned one of the 200 pressings of the broadcast issued by Nine Point records. I was disappointed to realise that the CD doesn’t contain the entire broadcast, but of course, that would’ve been too easy and insufficiently conceptual. My copy has two, apparently random, 30 minute chunks.</p>
<p>The product itself contains a fairly lengthy essay in its sleeve which makes some gesture towards enclosing the meaning or significance of Black brain radio. Of course, it makes no such claims for itself, but it’s hard not to regard it as a manifesto for the work, outfitted with Dadaistic murals and slogans, positing radio as a more immanent mode of dissemination than television; its history more implicated with the opposed forces of revolution and fascism. It’s a slightly essentialist history, it claims radio has a power to foster community while running counter to globalisation, but it’s a well-written and a competent anatomising of the project, and how it aims to transcend fascistic taste-makers of art and democratise its appreciation. Now I will criticise it. I don’t think that Black brain radio quite rose to the heights of anti-globalisation, de-naturation of self and disarticulation of the simulated nature of community that the essay posits, nor do I see the kind of engagement with manufactured consent, the point at which opinions are generated by our encounters with mass-media outlets. Rather, I see it as definitively located within a critique of the artifice of commercial radio.</p>
<p>Ben Anderson praises the vitality and capacity of radio to create communities through voice, but Black brain radio seems far too drained, or doubled back on itself to be indicative of a community spirit being generated in this way. Rather, I see or behold in Black brain radio an antiquarian anxiously parsing transcripts of an irretrievably lost past with no sense of its context, or even how it should be read. Phelan speaks in a cold, blank drawl and what springs to mind of course is Beckett’s radio plays, but without Beckett’s rhythm or bursts of lyricism. This is highlighted all the more by the sardonic intrusions of the overplayed radio hits of the day used occasionally as an audio bed (albeit without the high standard of production one would expect from a ‘normal’ broadcast). Snoop Dogg’s tune Signs (feat. Justin Timberlake &amp; Charlie Wilson) features, followed by the usual senseless over-production, overheard from FM 104 that Phelan leaves on while he’s recording, that leavens mass-media artefacts. ‘Fun fact’ type segments wherein tedious information is rehearsed also, interspersed with milquetoast banter from co-hosts in the same lifeless, blank tone of an over-long exhalation.</p>
