				<p><strong>The Two Factors of the Commodity</strong></p>
<p><em>125</em> The capitalist economy consists of commodities. A commodity is an object of consumption or of production. It satisfies a need, this need is referred to as the commodity’s use-value.</p>
<p><em>[126 Footnote cites Locke ‘The natural worth of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities, or serve the conveniences of human life’.</em></p>
<p><em>Funny sidebar: ‘In English writers of the seventeenth century we still often find the word ‘worth’ used for use-value and ‘value’ for exchange value. This is quite in accordance with the spirit of a language that likes to use a Teutonic word for the actual thing, and a Romance word for its reflection’.]</em></p>
<p>Where these needs arise from is a broader social question but use-value is also in the physical thing itself; it has a real existence and the use is realised in the commodity’s consumption whereas the thing-ness of the commodity is the bearer of its exchange-value.</p>
<p><em>[Footnote: ‘In bourgeois society the legal fiction prevails that each person, as a buyer, has an encyclopaedic knowledge of commodities’.]</em></p>
<p><em>127</em> Exchange-value renders a commodity commensurate, makes it possible to compare and conflate it with other things and have it move around in exchange for those things. So a given commodity, e.g. wheat ‘has many exchange values instead of one’. So we might say 1 corn = x iron or x wool or x coal etc.</p>
<p>This exchange value is an abstraction, it expresses use value at a level beyond the mere commodity itself, it is quantitative.</p>
<p><em>128</em> Use value is qualitative, it works at the point of consumption. If you’re hungry, cheese will do you while steel won’t.</p>
<p>Exchange value works at the point of quantity; if you’re hungry and you have steel you could exchange it for cheese, but these two functions are distinct. You can’t eat an exchange value or hammer it into a car.</p>
<p>In order to penetrate into exchange value it is necessary to abstract from the commodity’s physicality. Considered from the perspective of exchange value, the commodity’s physical, tangible, sensuous aspects are evacuated. Viewed the perspective of exchange it’s not important that something is a table or a piece of yarn, more that it is an abstract incarnation of human labour.</p>
<p><em>129</em> And as this is quantitative, the decisive unit is the amount of labour which ‘is measured by its duration…on the particular scale of hours, days, etc’.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that if a labourer takes six months to make a single shirt that shirt is worth millions, because while it is a quantitative measurement its also an abstract one; all human labour is considered here as a single homogenous mass. Labour-power, the magnitude of labour-power, is ‘a socially average unit of labour power and acts as such, i.e. only needs, in order to produce a commodity, the labour time which is necessary on average’.</p>
<p>So there is an equilibrium which is called socially necessary labour-time. And this average is ‘the labour time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society’.</p>
<p>The example Marx gives is English hand-loom weavers, after the introduction of power-looms, which ‘reduced…by one half the labour required to convert a given quantity of yarn into woven fabric. In order to do this the English hand-loom weaver in fact needed the same amount of labour-time as before; but the product of his individual hour of labour now only represented half an hour of social labour, and consequently fell to one half its former value’.</p>
<p><em>[Cool footnote where he finds his theory anticipated in a document on Money written in the 1730’s]</em></p>
<p><em>130</em> So the value of a commodity would remain static if the labour-time required for production remained static. But this changes with every variation in the productivity of labour, which is very much effected by advances in technology and machinery as well as:</p>
<ol>
<li>the worker’s average degree of skill</li>
<li>the social organisation of the producers of production
3.the extent and effectiveness of the means of production</li>
<li>conditions found in the natural environment (e.g. the same quantity of labour is present in eight bushels of corn in favourable seasons and only four in unfavourable seasons, ‘the same quantity of labour provides more metal in rich mines than in poor’.)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>131</em> So there are enormous differences of context that dictate fluctuations in value: ‘In general, the greater their productivity of labour, the less the labour-time required to produce an article, the less the mass of labour crystallised in that article, and the less its value. The value of a  commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productivity, of the labour which finds its realisation within the commodity’.</p>
<p>A thing can be a use-value without being a value, i.e. directly obtained without mediation through exchange and the example is the peasant who farms for direct consumption of himself or his feudal lord:</p>
<p><em>‘Neither the corn-rent nor the corn-tithe became commodities simply by being produced for others. In order to become a commodity the product must be transferred to the other person, for whom it serves as a use-value, through the medium of exchange’.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities</strong></p>
<p><em>132</em> In a society based on commodity production, labour is necessarily divided.</p>
<p><em>133</em> ‘in a society of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour which are carried on independently and privately by individual producers develops into a complex system, a social division of labour’.</p>
<p>But labour is a condition of human existence before commodities as defined above became dominant; clothes were made in antiquity, farming was divided in pre-historical agriculture.</p>
<p><em>137</em> Difference between concrete v abstract labour introduced here; the former pertaining to use value, the second to exchange.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Value Form, or Exchange-Value</strong></p>
<p><em>138</em> Commodities have both concrete and abstract traits, the natural hunger-satisfying aspects of cheese, the durability of steel, but also the abstract commensurate, exchangeable characteristics.</p>
<p><em>141</em> Once again it is the value form that allows commodities to become commensurate with one another.</p>
<p><em>142</em> Labour-power is not value in itself, it only becomes value once it is concretised in an objective form.</p>
<p><em>143 ‘As a use-value, the linen is something palpably different from the coat; as value, it is identical with the coat, and therefore looks like the coat. Thus the linen acquires a value-form different from its natural form. Its existence as value is manifested in its equality with the coat, just as the sheep-like nature of the Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God’.</em></p>
<p><em>145</em> As before this commensurability in varies in context, ‘the labour-time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every influence in the productivity of the weaver or the tailor’</p>
<p><em>147</em> Commodity A (the linen) imposes on Commodity B a form of value particular to it, the equivalent. The linen brings into view its own existence as a value in the fact that it can be assumed as a form of value distinct from its own physical being. In this way the commodity’s value is no longer qualitative but becomes relative,</p>
<p><em>148</em> because a commodity can never express the magnitude of its own value. It needs that reflection in the form of a Commodity B.</p>
<p><em>149</em> Value is therefore social, it’s not something that can be measured independently, we can’t use this method to understand the amount of value in a single tyre or cheese-wheel taken outside of its context in the productive process.</p>
<p><em>150</em> Another thing that commensurability makes possible, is the comparison of concrete labour, private labour in the linen with abstract labour, social labour embodied in the coat.</p>
<p><em>151</em> Section about how Aristotle could not think his way past market relations without this concept of value, Aristotle couldn’t see that what every pair of commodities have in common is abstract labour.</p>
<p><em>153</em> Examples of two schools of orthodox economists who only grapple with one side of value, whether quantitative or qualitative, and miss the actual phenomenon as a result.</p>
<p><em>156</em> There is no end to this process of comparison and exchange: ‘it follows that the relative form of value of each commodity is an endless series of expressions of value which are all different from the relative form of value of every other commodity’.</p>
<p><em>162</em> The general form of value then gives way to the money form.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secret</strong></p>
<p><em>167</em> This next step from value to money is a necessary extension because producers do not come into contact with one another on the market through barter, their purchases are mediated through the market.</p>
<p><em>168</em> It takes a long time and a certain amount of development before this market becomes a generalised law, before the production of commodities has become fully developed, but underneath this law, whose relations are obscured or reified because the way the market operates is not necessarily traceable ‘is therefore a secret hidden under the apparent movements in the relative values of commodities’.</p>
<p><em>169</em> The reified character of these social relations find their expression in the self-evidently incorrect assertions put forward by orthodox political economy.</p>
<p><em>[175 footnote: ‘the vulgar economists confine themselves to systematising in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlasting truths, the banal and complacent notions held by the bourgeois agents of production about their own world, which is to them the best possible one’, and he calls a few of these economists dwarfs and asses.]</em></p>
<p><em>170</em> Uses feudalism and the story of Robinson Crusoe (a novel written by Daniel Defoe in 1719 about a man who washes up on an island off the coast of Venezuela and establishes a himself ‘self-sufficient society’) in order to describe moments, whether historical or imagined, in which the trajectory of commodities, outputs of labour and /or agriculture are clear: ‘the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour appear at all events as their own personal relations, and are not disguised as social relations between things, between the products of labour’.</p>
<p><em>171</em> Rare, brief reference to what a communist society would look like ‘Let us finally imagine…an association of free men, working with the means of production held in common, and expending their many different forms of labour-power in full self-awareness as one single social labour force’.</p>
<p><em>172 - 176</em> Just some fantastic riffs on political economy and Christianity.</p>
