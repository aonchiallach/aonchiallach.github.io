<p><strong>Chapter One: Commodities</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two Factors of the Commodity</strong></p>
<p><em>125</em> The capitalist economy consists of commodities. A commodity is an object of consumption or of production. It satisfies a need, this need is referred to as the commodity’s use-value.</p>
<p><em>[126 Footnote cites Locke ‘The natural worth of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities, or serve the conveniences of human life’.</em></p>
<p><em>Funny sidebar: ‘In English writers of the seventeenth century we still often find the word ‘worth’ used for use-value and ‘value’ for exchange value. This is quite in accordance with the spirit of a language that likes to use a Teutonic word for the actual thing, and a Romance word for its reflection’.]</em></p>
<p>Where these needs arise from is a broader social question but use-value is also in the physical thing itself; it has a real existence and the use is realised in the commodity’s consumption whereas the thing-ness of the commodity is the bearer of its exchange-value.</p>
<p><em>[Footnote: ‘In bourgeois society the legal fiction prevails that each person, as a buyer, has an encyclopaedic knowledge of commodities’.]</em></p>
<p><em>127</em> Exchange-value renders a commodity commensurate, makes it possible to compare and conflate it with other things and have it move around in exchange for those things. So a given commodity, e.g. wheat ‘has many exchange values instead of one’. So we might say 1 corn = x iron or x wool or x coal etc.</p>
<p>This exchange value is an abstraction, it expresses use value at a level beyond the mere commodity itself, it is quantitative.</p>
<p><em>128</em> Use value is qualitative, it works at the point of consumption. If you’re hungry, cheese will do you while steel won’t.</p>
<p>Exchange value works at the point of quantity; if you’re hungry and you have steel you could exchange it for cheese, but these two functions are distinct. You can’t eat an exchange value or hammer it into a car.</p>
<p>In order to penetrate into exchange value it is necessary to abstract from the commodity’s physicality. Considered from the perspective of exchange value, the commodity’s physical, tangible, sensuous aspects are evacuated. Viewed the perspective of exchange it’s not important that something is a table or a piece of yarn, more that it is an abstract incarnation of human labour.</p>
<p><em>129</em> And as this is quantitative, the decisive unit is the amount of labour which ‘is measured by its duration…on the particular scale of hours, days, etc’.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that if a labourer takes six months to make a single shirt that shirt is worth millions, because while it is a quantitative measurement its also an abstract one; all human labour is considered here as a single homogenous mass. Labour-power, the magnitude of labour-power, is ‘a socially average unit of labour power and acts as such, i.e. only needs, in order to produce a commodity, the labour time which is necessary on average’.</p>
<p>So there is an equilibrium which is called socially necessary labour-time. And this average is ‘the labour time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society’.</p>
<p>The example Marx gives is English hand-loom weavers, after the introduction of power-looms, which ‘reduced…by one half the labour required to convert a given quantity of yarn into woven fabric. In order to do this the English hand-loom weaver in fact needed the same amount of labour-time as before; but the product of his individual hour of labour now only represented half an hour of social labour, and consequently fell to one half its former value’.</p>
<p><em>[Cool footnote where he finds his theory anticipated in a document on Money written in the 1730’s]</em></p>
<p><em>130</em> So the value of a commodity would remain static if the labour-time required for production remained static. But this changes with every variation in the productivity of labour, which is very much effected by advances in technology and machinery as well as:</p>
<ol>
<li>the worker’s average degree of skill</li>
<li>the social organisation of the producers of production</li>
<li>the extent and effectiveness of the means of production</li>
<li>conditions found in the natural environment (e.g. the same quantity of labour is present in eight bushels of corn in favourable seasons and only four in unfavourable seasons, ‘the same quantity of labour provides more metal in rich mines than in poor’.)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>131</em> So there are enormous differences of context that dictate fluctuations in value: ‘In general, the greater their productivity of labour, the less the labour-time required to produce an article, the less the mass of labour crystallised in that article, and the less its value. The value of a  commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productivity, of the labour which finds its realisation within the commodity’.</p>
<p>A thing can be a use-value without being a value, i.e. directly obtained without mediation through exchange and the example is the peasant who farms for direct consumption of himself or his feudal lord:</p>
<p><em>‘Neither the corn-rent nor the corn-tithe became commodities simply by being produced for others. In order to become a commodity the product must be transferred to the other person, for whom it serves as a use-value, through the medium of exchange’.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities</strong></p>
<p><em>132</em> In a society based on commodity production, labour is necessarily divided.</p>
<p><em>133</em> ‘in a society of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour which are carried on independently and privately by individual producers develops into a complex system, a social division of labour’.</p>
<p>But labour is a condition of human existence before commodities as defined above became dominant; clothes were made in antiquity, farming was divided in pre-historical agriculture.</p>
<p><em>137</em> Difference between concrete v abstract labour introduced here; the former pertaining to use value, the second to exchange.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Value Form, or Exchange-Value</strong></p>
<p><em>138</em> Commodities have both concrete and abstract traits, the natural hunger-satisfying aspects of cheese, the durability of steel, but also the abstract commensurate, exchangeable characteristics.</p>
<p><em>141</em> Once again it is the value form that allows commodities to become commensurate with one another.</p>
<p><em>142</em> Labour-power is not value in itself, it only becomes value once it is concretised in an objective form.</p>
<p><em>143 ‘As a use-value, the linen is something palpably different from the coat; as value, it is identical with the coat, and therefore looks like the coat. Thus the linen acquires a value-form different from its natural form. Its existence as value is manifested in its equality with the coat, just as the sheep-like nature of the Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God’.</em></p>
<p><em>145</em> As before this commensurability in varies in context, ‘the labour-time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every influence in the productivity of the weaver or the tailor’</p>
<p><em>147</em> Commodity A (the linen) imposes on Commodity B a form of value particular to it, the equivalent. The linen brings into view its own existence as a value in the fact that it can be assumed as a form of value distinct from its own physical being. In this way the commodity’s value is no longer qualitative but becomes relative,</p>
<p><em>148</em> because a commodity can never express the magnitude of its own value. It needs that reflection in the form of a Commodity B.</p>
<p><em>149</em> Value is therefore social, it’s not something that can be measured independently, we can’t use this method to understand the amount of value in a single tyre or cheese-wheel taken outside of its context in the productive process.</p>
<p><em>150</em> Another thing that commensurability makes possible, is the comparison of concrete labour, private labour in the linen with abstract labour, social labour embodied in the coat.</p>
<p><em>151</em> Section about how Aristotle could not think his way past market relations without this concept of value, Aristotle couldn’t see that what every pair of commodities have in common is abstract labour.</p>
<p><em>153</em> Examples of two schools of orthodox economists who only grapple with one side of value, whether quantitative or qualitative, and miss the actual phenomenon as a result.</p>
<p><em>156</em> There is no end to this process of comparison and exchange: ‘it follows that the relative form of value of each commodity is an endless series of expressions of value which are all different from the relative form of value of every other commodity’.</p>
<p><em>162</em> The general form of value then gives way to the money form.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secret</strong></p>
<p><em>167</em> This next step from value to money is a necessary extension because producers do not come into contact with one another on the market through barter, their purchases are mediated through the market.</p>
<p><em>168</em> It takes a long time and a certain amount of development before this market becomes a generalised law, before the production of commodities has become fully developed, but underneath this law, whose relations are obscured or reified because the way the market operates is not necessarily traceable ‘is therefore a secret hidden under the apparent movements in the relative values of commodities’.</p>
<p><em>169</em> The reified character of these social relations find their expression in the self-evidently incorrect assertions put forward by orthodox political economy.</p>
<p><em>[175 footnote: ‘the vulgar economists confine themselves to systematising in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlasting truths, the banal and complacent notions held by the bourgeois agents of production about their own world, which is to them the best possible one’, and he calls a few of these economists dwarfs and asses.]</em></p>
<p><em>170</em> Uses feudalism and the story of Robinson Crusoe (a novel written by Daniel Defoe in 1719 about a man who washes up on an island off the coast of Venezuela and establishes a himself ‘self-sufficient society’) in order to describe moments, whether historical or imagined, in which the trajectory of commodities, outputs of labour and /or agriculture are clear: ‘the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour appear at all events as their own personal relations, and are not disguised as social relations between things, between the products of labour’.</p>
<p><em>171</em> Rare, brief reference to what a communist society would look like ‘Let us finally imagine…an association of free men, working with the means of production held in common, and expending their many different forms of labour-power in full self-awareness as one single social labour force’.</p>
<p><em>172 - 176</em> Just some fantastic riffs on political economy and Christianity.</p>

<p><em>178</em> Commodities cannot circulate by themselves,</p>
<p><em>179</em> their buyers and sellers must encounter one another in the market as &lsquo;personifications of economic relations&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the seller, a commodity has no use-value, for the buyer it does. The changing of hands constitutes exchange.</p>
<p><em>181</em> Money arises out of these requirements and further entrenches the separation between use-value and value.</p>
<p><em>182 - 3</em> Brief account of the historical roots of money, how it first arises among nomadic peoples because &lsquo;all their worldly possessions are in a movable and therefore directly alienable form, and because their mode of life, by continually bringing them into contact with foreign communities, encourages the exchange of products&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>183</em> In order to better service the needs of circulation in a modern society, the money-form assumes the shape of commodities naturally best fitted to &lsquo;perform the social function of a universal equivalent&rsquo;: precious metals.</p>
<p><em>184</em> these are suitable because their &rsquo;every sample possesses the same uniform quantity&rsquo; and because they are divisible.</p>
<p><em>185</em> Just because precious metals represent a symbol of value does not mean that they are unreal; they give witness to an actual social relationship. As with commodities, precious metals exist on both the concrete and abstract levels: &rsquo;every commodity is a symbol, since, as value, it is only the material shell of the human labour expended on it&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>186</em> Money is also similar to the commodity in the sense that its value can only be expressed in other forms of itself, this value being determined &lsquo;by the labour-time required for its production&hellip;expressed in the quantity of any other commodity in which the same amount of labour-time is congealed&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>187</em> Once money has become a universal equivalent, human activity becomes increasingly atomised; &lsquo;Their own relations of production&hellip;assume a material shape which is independent of their control and their conscious individual action&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Measure of Values</strong></p>
<p><em>188</em> It is not just money that renders commodities commensurate, they already are commensurate by virtue of having human labour in common.</p>
<p><em>189</em> But money does grant this equation of commodities a socially valid character, there is no longer any need for the 1 iron = 5 wheat because of money.</p>
<p><em>191</em> Gold then becomes a universal measurement: &lsquo;in spite of the confusing variety of the commodities themselves, their values become magnitudes of the same denomination, gold-magnitudes&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>193</em> Digression on how the price of money and the price of commodities are independent; one may rise and one may fall, both may rise or fall together.</p>
<p>The terms originally assigned to specific amounts of precious metals (a &lsquo;pound&rsquo; initially referred to a pound of silver) become autonomous over time because of:</p>
<ol>
<li>the introduction of foreign coinage which develop different names</li>
<li>the development of material wealth; copper edging out silver, edged out in turn by gold</li>
<li>successive waves of de-valuation</li>
</ol>
<p><em>194</em> In this way the nature of money has been reified beyond its actual function, a confusion assisted in no small part that they are at once real and unreal.</p>
<p><em>[One enduring controversy of Marxist economics and / or Marxology is known as the transformation problem, namely whether or not Marx provides us with a comprehensive account of how the abstract value of the commodity becomes a concrete price in a competitive marketplace. There are a number of comments in this chapter which pertain to this question so they will be signally from this point on]</em></p>
<p><em>196</em> <em>Material on the Transformation Problem</em></p>
<p>The magnitude of a commodity&rsquo;s value expresses the socially average labour-time required to produce it. When this commodity&rsquo;s value is realised, when it sold, this appears as the exchange-ratio between a single commodity and the money-commodity.</p>
<p>This relation may express the magnitude of value and the greater or lesser quantity of money it can be sold for according to a particular set of circumstances. Therefore there is very much the possibility that there will be a disproportion between these two; in fact this is fundamental to the price-form.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;This is not a defect, but, on the contrary, it makes this form the adequate one for a mode of production whose laws can only assert themselves as blindly operating averages between constant irregularities&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>197</em> Price might cease to express value altogether; one could sell courage or honour, things which command a price without value, but it might also conceal a real value-relation.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Means of Circulation</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) The Metamorphosis of Commodities</strong></p>
<p><em>198</em> Great image regarding the nature of contradiction</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;it is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another and at the same time constantly flying away from it. The ellipse is a form of motion within which this contradiction is both realised and resolved&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>This paradoxical occurrence within the mode of production known as capitalism is called the social metabolism.</p>
<p><em>200</em> We are given a simple, two-stage equation to express the process of exchange:</p>
<p>Commodity -&gt; Money -&gt; Commodity or CMC</p>
<p>The first stage, commodity to money, is the decisive moment, this decides whether or not a commodity can command a price.</p>
<p><em>201 - 3</em> In order for a commodity to command a price, it must have a use-value for the purchaser.</p>
<p><em>Material on the Transformation Problem</em></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;We leave out of consideration here any possible subjective errors in calculation by the owner of the commodity, which will immediately be corrected objectively in the market. We suppose him to have spent only the average socially necessary quantity of labour time. The price of the commodity&hellip;is merely the money-name of the quantity of social labour objectified in it&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>The articulation of this metamorphosis is however, not straightforward, but takes place in haphazard and spontaneous ways across the market, the sellers</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;find out that the same division of labour which turns them into private producers also makes the social process of production and the relations of the individual producers to each other&hellip;independent of the producers themselves&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;The realisation of a commodity&rsquo;s price, or of its merely ideal value-form, is therefore at the same time, and inversely, the realisation of the merely ideal use-value of money; the conversion of a commodity into money is the conversion of money into a commodity&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>Every purchase is a sale, every sale a purchase, C -&gt; M is also at once M -&gt; C from the point of view of the buyer.</p>
<p><em>208</em> But this does not mean equilbrium is achieved. Every sale might well be a purchase, but they constitute two separate acts between two people in opposition to one another.</p>
<p><em>209</em> Their independence from one another may also assert themselves as occurs in a crisis.</p>
<p><strong>(b) The Circulation of Money</strong></p>
<p><em>213</em> Since money and commodities always come into physical confrontation with each other, the amount of money that is required is equal to the sum of all prices. Since prices rise and fall, the amount of money required to move commodities around may also rise or fall.</p>
<p><em>214</em> More on price:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;one commodity infects another through their common value-relation, so that their prices, expressed in gold or silver, gradually settle down into the proportions determined by their comparative values, until finally the values of all commodities are estimated in terms of the new value of the monetary metal&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>As prices rise the amount of money needed to facilitate their circulations also rises, which leads some to think inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods.</p>
<p><em>216</em> A decisive factor here is the question of turnover:</p>
<p>the quantity of money function as the circulating medium = the sum of prices / divided the number of times coins of the same denomination turn over</p>
<p>How often each coin turns over = velocity.</p>
<p>This measure differs to a large extent according to context, place, time, level of social development etc.</p>
<p>If there are less turnovers, less coin is necessary and vice versa.</p>
<p><em>217</em> These dynamics too might provoke the system into crisis as they are non-simultaneous. As before, orthodox economists ascribe this to insufficient money in the system.</p>
<p>[<em>218 Footnote:</em> which is not to say that the idea is entirely without merit, but it is only one possible reason for a crisis that often has the result of de-emphasising more long-run dynamics.]</p>
<p><strong>(c) Coin. The Symbol of Value</strong></p>
<p><em>221</em> In sum, average value commands average price.</p>
<p><em>222 - 3</em> History of the use of precious metals as money, the role of the state in minting them.</p>
<p><em>224</em> Introduction of credit and paper money into the argument.</p>
<p><em>225</em> Only insofar as paper money represents gold does it have value.</p>
<p><strong>3. Money</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) Hoarding</strong></p>
<p><em>227</em> As money becomes that universal repository of value, the urge develops to retain a hold over it, as it is an index of social power.</p>
<p><em>229 - 230</em> Various quotes from classical sources about the dangers of money as tending towards the destruction of previously existing social relations.</p>
